The thrust of the piece was that lengthy goodbyes are not good for business.<br></p><blockquote>What is the point of these lengthy handovers? Once your departure is announced, your authority leaves with it. Your mind, however hard you try, is surely turning to what you do next.</blockquote><p>It went on to cite three examples:&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c101b5a-3561-11e3-952b-00144feab7de.html#slide0">Angela Ahrendts</a></span>&nbsp;who is leaving <span><a href="http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=uk:BRBY">Burberry</a>,</span>&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc5d4d62-0bf4-11e3-8840-00144feabdc0.html">Steve Ballmer </a>who&nbsp;</span>is stepping down as chief executive of <span><a href="http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:MSFT">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;a</span>nd Sir Nicholas Hytner who is retiring as director of Britainâ€™s <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4d4ddaca-3596-11e3-b539-00144feab7de.html"><span>National Theatre</span></a>.<br><br>In each case there is a lengthy gap - up to 18 months - before the departees actually depart.<br><br>My recent experience of retiring after 30 years at RBI has taught me that the less time between the announcement and the departure the better. In my case we informed the company at the end of September and my actual agreed leaving date was today - quite a short period, it seems, in senior business circles.<br><br>Even so, I could see the problems of an extended stay. The process of announcing your departure follows a pretty set pattern. The announcement goes out and there are (hopefully) general expressions of shock and dismay. Shortly afterwards, though, people's attention turns to what and who comes next. Then the emails get less frequent and there are slightly fewer meetings. You can see the calculation in people's minds as they work out whether you are going to be around for the conclusion of whatever project you are being asked to validate or comment on. Quite quickly the organisation heals around your future absence. So the faster you get out the better for everybody.<br><br>This reaction is entirely healthy: companies exist for what they can do in the present and the future and not what they have done in the past. Once a departure date has been announced you become part of the past - better to acknowledge it and move along gracefully. I agree with the FT: no good can come of the lengthy goodbyes.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/internet-economy/">Internet Economy</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./climate-change-stories.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Climate change stories</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./cambridges-area-51.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Cambridge&#x27;s Area 51?</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1362/responsive/IMG_3867-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="313" width="313"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
