At a stroke this would double the rate of growth of rooftop solar.<p></p><p>According to Government figures published in January 2014 there were <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2322628/uk-solar-panels-reach-half-a-million-rooftop-milestone">around 500,000 rooftop installations of solar panels in the UK </a>and given the speed with which they were being installed at least another 100,000 should have been added since.</p><p>The NHBC says there were just over 145,000 new homes built during 2014 and it looks likely the same or more will be built again this year (There have been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/20/uk-double-number-new-homes-300000-vince-cable">calls for at least 300,000 homes to be built</a> to ease the housing crisis). Adding solar to all those roofs could have a dramatic impact.</p><p>This is not a new idea. In 2012 <a href="http://www.johnstevensonmp.co.uk/carlisle-mp-welcomes-solar-revolution-announcement/">Carlisle MP John Stevenson</a> called on the Government to make it compulsory that all new-builds have solar panels, but to no effect.</p><p>Given the targets for emissions reduction set out in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Act_2008">Climate Change Act of 2008</a> simple measures like this should have appeal.</p><p>One potential issue is the added cost. However, a typical system costs <a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/domestic/content/solar-panels">between £5k and £8k</a> and the average home in the UK now costs £272,000 so even assuming the whole sum was added to the price (unlikely given the economies of scale) that's a hike of less than 3%. Given the fact that the panels effectively mean free electricity in the future any increased house price should be baked in for the future, too.</p><p>And it's likely that the innovation spurred by all that activity will reduce costs in the future - solar costs have already plummeted as this chart illustrates nicely.</p><figure class="size-medium wp-image-1558 aligncenter"><a href="http://www.inflectionpointblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/1393/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300.jpg" alt="price-of-solar-power-drop-graph" width="243" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1393/responsive/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1393/responsive/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1393/responsive/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1393/responsive/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1393/responsive/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1393/responsive/price-of-solar-power-drop-graph-243x300-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><p></p><p>Another concern is aesthetics, although this is again likely to be overblown. Firstly, what is aesthetically normal changes over time (think electricity pylons) so as panels become more widespread their acceptance will grow. Secondly, with a steady market housebuilders and architects are likely to compete to develop more visually appealing installations, which again should lead to a rapid increase in innovation and benefit the further acceleration of solar adoption.</p><p>The share of UK electricity generated through solar of all types (commercial and large scale included) was 1.25% <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_Kingdom#cite_note-DECC-trends2015-44">according to Government figures</a> but it is rising rapidly. Sensible interventions could supercharge the growth.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/climate-change-2/">Climate Change</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-radical-potential-of-blockchain.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The radical potential of Blockchain</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-apple-watch-challenge.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Apple Watch challenge</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
