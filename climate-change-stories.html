The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/28/observer-editorial-climate-change-government-must-act">leader set the tone</a> with a strong call for action in the face of the IPCC report.&nbsp;</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">Last week, the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" style="background-color: white; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; border-collapse: collapse; color: #005689; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none;">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;published its fifth assessment report on the physical science of global warming and made it clear that the continued burning of fossil fuels to run our cars, factories and electricity plants is now virtually certain to induce serious alterations to our climate.&nbsp;</span></span></blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Then there was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/29/climate-change-energy-sources-solar-power">the piece by David King and Richard Layard</a> calling for a world sunpower programme:</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The goal would be by 2025 to deliver solar electricity at scale to the grid at a cost below the cost of fossil fuel. All countries would be invited to participate. Those who did would commit, in their own countries, to major new programmes of research, internationally co-ordinated, and to share their findings for the benefit of the world.</span></span></blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;In contrast, however, were two of the (very few) articles in the New York Times Observer supplement, presumably hand picked from the raft of stories which the NYT covers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/world/europe/germanys-effort-at-clean-energy-proves-complex.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">The first</a> focussed on the economic difficulties faced by Germany's green energy policies.</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">German families are being hit by rapidly increasing electricity rates, to the point where growing numbers of them can no longer afford to pay the bill. Businesses are more and more worried that their energy costs will put them at a disadvantage to competitors in nations with lower energy costs, and some energy-intensive industries have begun to shun the country because they fear steeper costs ahead.</span></span></blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">The second was a piece <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/science/earth/unlocking-the-potential-of-flammable-ice.html?pagewanted=all">explaining the potential of unlocking frozen hydrates</a>&nbsp;as a potential new (carbon) fuel source.&nbsp;</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">If they can be tapped safely and economically, they could be an abundant source of fuel, especially for countries like Japan that have few energy reserves of their own.</span></span></blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">There in the Observer (and supplements) this morning the complexity of the climate change issue was laid out.&nbsp;</span><br></p><ol><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">We have a serious problem with CO2;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">We know that we have to reduce hydrocarbons in favour of renewables;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">But the infrastructure and economics of the oil and gas industries have the advantage and the momentum;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Renewables are costly and going it alone is fraught with perils (see Germany);</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">A "moonshot" is therefore required.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">What are the chances of this happening? The Observer leader I started with sums it up:&nbsp;</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">What Britain urgently needs is an unambiguous statement from our government that it recognises very serious changes are now affecting our planet; that we have the will to tackle a growing global catastrophe; and that we are prepared to address difficult, unpopular truths. To date, we have heard nothing.</span>&nbsp;</span></blockquote></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./has-apple-lost-its-innovation-mojo.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1342/responsive/iphone_5s_colors_stacked_apple_16x9-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="768" width="768"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Has Apple lost its innovation mojo?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./lingering-is-bad-for-business.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Lingering is bad for business</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2007-07-10T06:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2007</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./google-to-move-on-exchange.html">Google to move on Exchange?</a></h3></header><p>EWeek sees the latest Google acquisition of security firm Postini as evidence that it is gearing itself up to challege Exchange in the corporate email space.
