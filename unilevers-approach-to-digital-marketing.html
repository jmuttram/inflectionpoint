She says the big shift was away from campaigns to 24/7 always on support. This has meant moving from banners and websites to search, gaming and other more integrated online experiences. "We are now breaking out of the confines of the word 'digital'," she says. "Six months ago I banned the word 'website"."<br><br>The web is inherently female - women are flocking online, blogging, chatting, shopping... hence <a href="http://www.inthemotherhood.com/">In the Motherhood</a> - a site in which women are invited to share their real life stories, vote of them and the best ones then become part of the script of the associated TV sitcom. This was a partnership with MSN and a production company, and not through an agency - quite a threat to the agency world, you would think, given that Unilever is the second largest advertiser in the world.<br><br>"Only the web can deliver things which are almost as powerful, if not more powerful, than TV". Hope yet for those of us who have online properties without effective ROI-based options...<br><br>Karl Schneider asks what metrics would be valuable. "Integrated metrics - we are not looking for independently measured metrics. We are throwing them all into research."<br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/AOP%2007" rel="tag">AOP 07</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./itvcom-aims-for-the-top-spot.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> ITV.com aims for the top spot</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-challenges-of-managing-user-interaction.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The challenges of managing user interaction</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2007-06-12T21:21" class="feed__date">June 12, 2007</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./another-us-newspaper-bites-the-digital-bullet.html">Another US newspaper bites the digital bullet</a></h3></header><p>The Greenboro News &#38; Record has restructured, with the loss of some jobs, in the face of the move to digitising news.
