It is important to realise the the scale is large - metropolitan and long-term. This means, a strong vision of what kind of city is being built it critical. And it means strong leadership and being prepared to take risks. Often it has involved very significant investment, such as the Olympics in Barcelona, but these grand plays aren't enough on their own, as they can fail. </p><p></p><p></p><p>The successful cases have all developed diversified economies, have strengthened the central city and have invested in culture, heritage and quality of life. </p><p></p><p></p><p>The over-riding impression at the end though, underlined by perceptive questions from the audience, was that while the city may recover, many of the people who made their lives there often don't and that tectonic societal upheavals, such as the election of Trump, or Brexit, or populism in Italy, may the cost.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe we can look back on the cities themselves in 20 years with satisfaction that they recovered so well, but what happened to the broader society in the meantime is quite another question. </p><p></p><p></p><p><em>Don Carter is an architect, urban designer and developer of international renown.
