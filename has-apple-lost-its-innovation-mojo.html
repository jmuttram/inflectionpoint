The "5 disappointing things about hte iPhone 5S" are listed out: the screen remains the same; a faster processor - it's only just a phone!; no improvement in battery life; still no 128GB model; a little catch up, no innovation.</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19.984375px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The iPhone 5S has exactly what was expected: a faster processor and a better camera (one that merely catches up to the cameras in some other phones).

"Though the faster, sleeker, more powerful phone is unarguably cool, the steps forward are still incremental.

"They create their own and stick to it.

The bottom line for Forbes:</span><br></p><blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">Innovation is unquestionably becoming less glitzy but that’s because Cook is updating Apple at the platform level. In place of Jobs’ charismatic feature, design and miniaturization-led innovation, he is giving his team space to build the boat: a device platform that is powerful enough to integrate many more services, gives developers more scope; allows the iPhone to interact with more devices around the body and in nearby locations.</span>&nbsp;</span></blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the end this more subtle interpretation of the Apple strategy sounds to me more convincing.&nbsp;</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-car-as-a-new-frontier-for-whats-left-of-nokia.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The car as a new frontier for what&#x27;s left of Nokia?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./climate-change-stories.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Climate change stories</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-04-29T05:18" class="feed__date">April 29, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-roots-of-innovation.html">The roots of innovation</a></h3></header><p>For some reason I've found myself reading E H Gombrich's A Little History of the World and I was struck by this particular passage on the ascendency of the Greeks: Now unlike the Egyptians, the Babylonians and the Assyrians, these noblemen weren't interested in preserving&hellip;</p><a href="./the-roots-of-innovation.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-03-24T11:12" class="feed__date">March 24, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./san-francisco-innovation.html">San Francisco innovation</a></h3></header><p>Off to San Francisco tomorrow for a whistlestop tour of some innovative companies courtesy of the Reed Elsevier Innovation team.
