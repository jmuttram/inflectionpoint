My car went into product on April 5th and on April 23rd Tesla announced an upgrade. From that point the cars being made would have active suspension, longer range, faster charging and a few other things. I had just missed the boat.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But that is how it goes with Tesla - it's a fast moving company and things change. Prices go down after you've ordered your car, or, like me, improvements are made that you miss out on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, since almost everything on the car is software controlled, you also get updates unexpectedly. My car got Sentry Mode (which makes all the cameras record suspicious activity around your car), numerous computer games, Netflix and YouTube playback and a ream of updates to autopilot which make the car better and better. Even the windscreen wipers are getting better with the "Deep Rain" AI continually improving performance in different rainy conditions. I didn't order any of these things.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some day all cars will be made this way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./waiting-for-the-car.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Waiting for the car</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./charging.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Charging</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2020-04-29T19:11" class="feed__date">April 29, 2020</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./teslas-drive-further.html">Teslas drive further</a></h3></header><p>No, Iâ€™m not talking about range - the perpetual first question in any discussion with non-ev-drivers.
