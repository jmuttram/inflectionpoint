Well, I definitely decided that I wanted an electric car in January 2019 and there were relatively few cars available at that time. Mercedes had announced that they would be launching the EQC at some stage, and as a current (happy) Mercedes owner that would seem an obvious choice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, there were two big constraints: I travel to Norfolk at least every month which is 150 miles away. As charging options are extremely limited there I needed a car with a <strong>big range</strong>; I travel with two dogs, two parolets, five tortoises and up to five adults(!), so I need a lot of <strong>cargo space</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When the details of the EQC emerged it was obvious that it was a mid-sized SUV and, while it was likely to have the range I needed, it was short of space.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-1822"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/1432/eqc_side.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1432/responsive/eqc_side-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1432/responsive/eqc_side-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1432/responsive/eqc_side-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1432/responsive/eqc_side-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1432/responsive/eqc_side-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1432/responsive/eqc_side-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><figcaption>Mercedes EQC just didn't have enough room</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>That left Tesla as the only manufacturer who had cars big enough and with enough range to fit the bill. On closer inspection, the Model S, the family saloon, didn't have a big enough cargo space, so the Model X was the only choice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There were some positives and negatives to weigh up:</p><p></p><p></p><p>On the positive sides, I loved the fact that Tesla was building electric cars from the ground up and their integrated approach to hardware and software seemed to me the future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On the negative side, the nearest service centre was in Dartford, 30 minutes drive away on a good day, compared to a Mercedes service centre a short walk from my house (which meant I could drop my Merc in for a service and walk home).</p><p></p><p></p><p>It turns out, though, that the negatives are not nearly as significant as you might think. Electric cars need next to no servicing - Tesla used to suggest an annual service but now just relies on the cars to report when they need work. Because they have many fewer moving parts, there is much less to go wrong, and things like regenerative braking means brake disks and pads are unlikely to need changing for years. The only things you regularly need to worry about are windscreen washer fluid and wiper blades, and tyres.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, that was it - after a trip to the Tesla showroom in Canary Wharf and a short test drive, I took the plunge and ordered my car.</p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/climate-change-2/">Climate Change</a></li><li><a href="./tags/electric-cars/">Electric cars</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./new-years-resolution.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> New Year&#x27;s Resolution</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./waiting-for-the-car.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Waiting for the car</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-09-27T07:35" class="feed__date">September 27, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./google-processes-the-political-soundbite.html">Google processes the political soundbite</a></h3></header><p>A Google Labs application takes quotes from Google News and puts them into a kind of head-to-head spin machine.
