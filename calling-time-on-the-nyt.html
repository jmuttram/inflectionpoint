When asked what he would do if he was in charge of the paper he answered:</p><blockquote><p>Shut off the print edition right now. You&#8217;ve got to play offense. You&#8217;ve got to do what Intel did in &#8217;85 when it was getting killed by the Japanese in memory chips, which was its dominant business. And it famously killed the business&#8212;shut it off and focused on its much smaller business, microprocessors, because that was going to be the market of the future. And the minute Intel got out of playing defense and into playing offense, its future was secure. The newspaper companies have to do exactly the same thing.</p><p>The financial markets have discounted forward to the terminal conclusion for newspapers, which is basically bankruptcy. So at this point, if you&#8217;re one of these major newspapers and you shut off the printing press, your stock price would probably go up, despite the fact that you would lose 90 percent of your revenue. Then you play offense. And guess what? You&#8217;re an internet company.</p></blockquote><p>I wonder who's listening.</p><p>&#160;</p><div style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/NYT" rel="tag">NYT</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Andressen" rel="tag">Andressen</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Portfolio%20Magazine" rel="tag">Portfolio Magazine</a></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./how-to-write-better-for-the-web.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> How to write better for the web</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./demand-for-mobile-web-grows.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Demand for mobile web grows</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-10-07T05:45" class="feed__date">October 7, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./in-difficult-times.html">In difficult times...</a></h3></header><p>With t&#38;e budgets likely to be slashed around the world next year some enterprising bloggers have come up with a novel idea: free conferences on the web.
