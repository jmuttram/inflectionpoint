Here's the list:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.me.com/">MobileMe</a> - not sure why I pay for this, except that I was caught up in the hype and haven't got round to doing anything about it. There are probably better services like <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, but there you are...</li><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr </a>- I've been a Pro user for a long time, inspired to pay extra to remove the monthly upload limits.</li><li><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> - I upgraded to paid status in order to sync this excellent to do list program with my iPhone</li><li><a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">MindMeister </a>- an online mind mapping tool which is really superb. I upgraded to remove the cap on charts which I could create and share.</li><li><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote </a>- a brilliant note application . I was managing fine with the free account until it became really useful and I found myself dangerously near my monthly limit. I was happy to upgrade</li><li><a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a> - just because....I have subscribed for a long time. Would I miss it if my subscription lapsed? A bit I suspect...</li></ul><div>What's interesting about this list is that with the one exception on the end of the list what I pay for is functionality rather than straight content. In all those cases the services offered have many competitors but I was tempted to eventually pay be trying the service out, often for a long time, and really getting used to the value it provided.</div><p></p><div>All these services offered rich functionality, but there was a restriction which would only become an inconvenience if I was getting a lot of value (and use) out of the service - but not until (that is the important point). Those services which tried to get my money by crippling the service until I paid, didn't convince me to become a customer as I never got beyond the (irritated) experimentation stage.</div><p></p><div>I'm more and more convinced that this kind of model is the one with the most legs on the web right now, and I expect we will see a lot more currently free services offering this kind of "freemium" model, described so well in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Economics-Abundance-Changing-Business/dp/1905211473/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251648047&amp;sr=1-1">Chris Anderson's recent book </a>.
