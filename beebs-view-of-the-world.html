I've just found a link to it. Here are the principle:<br></p><p style="text-indent:20pt;font-family:serif;font-size:13pt;">1.	Build web products that meet audience needs: anticipate needs not yet fully articulated by audiences, then meet them with products that set new standards.<br>2.	The very best websites do one thing really, really well: do less, but execute perfectly.<br>3.	Do not attempt to do everything yourselves: link to other high-quality sites instead. Your users will thank you. Use other people's content and tools to enhance your site, and vice versa.<br>4.	Fall forward, fast: make many small bets, iterate wildly, back successes, kill failures, fast.<br>5.	Treat the entire web as a creative canvas: don't restrict your creativity to your own site. Look at "One Big Weekend".<br>6.	The web is a conversation. Join in. Adopt a relaxed, conversational tone. Admit your mistakes.<br>7.	Any website is only as good as its worst page. Ensure best practice editorial processes are adopted and adhered to.<br>8.	Make sure all your content can be linked to, forever.<br>9.	Remember your granny won't ever use “Second Life”. She may come online soon, with very different needs from early-adopters.<br>10.Maximise routes to content: Develop as many aggregations of content about people, places, topics, channels, networks &#38; time as possible. Optimise your site to rank high in Google.<br>11.Consistent design and navigation needn't mean one-size-fits-all: Users should always know they're on one of your websites, even if they all look very different. Most importantly of all, they know they won't ever get lost.<br>12.Accessibility is not an optional extra. Sites designed that way from the ground up work better for all users<br>13.Let people paste your content on the walls of their virtual homes. Let users take nuggets of content with them, with links back to your site<br>14.Link to discussions on the web, don't host them. Only host web-based discussions where there is a clear rationale<br>15.Personalisation should be unobtrusive, elegant and transparent: After all, it's their most personal data. Best respect it.</p><p></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/TV" rel="tag">TV</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./gym-etc-tighten-grip.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> GYM etc tighten grip</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./internet-video-to-win-out.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Internet video to win out</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-02-01T12:39" class="feed__date">February 1, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./googles-dual-view-of-the-world.html">Google&#x27;s Dual View of the World</a></h3></header><p>The Center for Citizen Media has posted links to identical Google Image searches for Tiananmen - one on the newly controversial Google China and the other one from the Google we all know and love.
