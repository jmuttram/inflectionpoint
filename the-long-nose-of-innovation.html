Buxton argues that innovation is really about the application of things already in existence as much as it is about inventing entirely new things.</p><p></p><p>This resonated with me as I thought about something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>, the futurologist, said in a recent lecture (which I can't now find!). He argued that since technology is growing exponentially, if you are building something (in his case computer translation software) you should design for what computers will be able to do by the time you are ready, now what they can do now.</p><p></p><p>It seems to me you could distill some good advice from these two: look for technologies and capabilities that are around now, but which have failed to reach their potential because computers or mobiles aren't powerful enough - then design something which will be truly impressive once the power catches up - which it will.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented reality</a> - likely to be all the rage in 2010 - falls into this category. The technologies have been around for ages (camera, compass, GPS), but it wasn't until they were combined into relatively cheap, powerful phones like the iPhone and Android that they could take off.</p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./recruiting-by-example.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Recruiting by example</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./twitter-stopped.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Twitter stopped</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2013-11-24T19:03" class="feed__date">November 24, 2013</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-boom-in-innovation.html">The boom in innovation</a></h3></header><p>I've spent the past couple of hours going through my feed reader catching up on all the stories I've missed over the past week or so and I was struck by the enormous number and inventiveness of the new apps and hardware being reported on.</p><a href="./the-boom-in-innovation.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2013-09-17T17:10" class="feed__date">September 17, 2013</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./has-apple-lost-its-innovation-mojo.html">Has Apple lost its innovation mojo?</a></h3></header><p>Has Apple has lost its innovation mojo?
