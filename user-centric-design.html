He discusses the problem of design as a pyramid with technology at the bottom, features in the middle, and at the top experience. Too often companies stop at either technology or features but it is experience (elegant simple solutions to complex products) is what marks out the great products. Apple famously exemplifies this, but “even” Microsoft is “getting it” with the latest version of Office (though as a Mac user he hasn’t personally tried it!)<br><br>Thank God for the wii, he says - “now I don’t just have to keep pointing to the ipod as a great example of user experience”.<br><br>Products are people too, he says. There’s a lot of research which shows that people interact with products the same way they do with other people. TiVo and Wii both have personalities provided by the manufacturers. We want to make cool products so what is it that makes people cool? They have integrity. The answer is what Tim O’Reilly as “designing from the outside in”. You need an “experience vision” - Kodak’s “you press the button, we do the rest” from 1880.<br><br>Palm succeeded where all others failed because it had a clear vision of where it was going - it designed the experience first, then added the features and finally decided on the technology.<br><br>Once the vision is written, adding a list of experiential requirements is a really useful way of developing the solution (allowing you to manage trade offs).</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./microsoft-fights-back.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Microsoft fights back</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./good-vs-great-design.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Good vs Great Design</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-09-12T08:45" class="feed__date">September 12, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./users-in-control.html">Users in control</a></h3></header><p>The San Francisco Chronical's site SFGate.com charts some fo the woes of social networking sites Facebook and Digg.
