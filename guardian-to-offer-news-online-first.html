The object is to not remain beholden to a 24-hour printing cycle and be beaten to important news by print and new media rivals."</em><br><br>Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/06/12/driving-readers-online/">makes a lot of </a>the announcement.<br><br>But as <a href="http://www.rati.com/general/meetteam.asp">Kieran Daly</a>, Group Editor of <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/">Flight</a>, points out in an email to me:<br><br><em>From our perspective, this is the key bit:<br><br>Rusbridger said: "Nearly all City information is now available on the day, and it seems to me a bit old-fashioned waiting for an artificial print deadline in order to put up City stories."<br>According to Rusbridger, the intention is for 95 per cent of stories to go straight up on the internet. He said: "If we had a world exclusive interview with George Bush that everyone was going to follow up, we might hold that back for the print edition."<br>The Guardian gets next to no city or foreign exclusives, so this is a logical move. But as Rusbridger acknowledges, if your material is exclusive then the situation is different.</em><br><br>And that, strangely enough, is the view taken by The Telegraph. <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/06/13/driving-readers-online-update/">According, again, to Jeff Jarvis</a>, despite rumours to the contrary, Telegraph journalists are free to publish whatever they like of the web as and when they like in order, just as the Guardian has said, not to be scooped by online rivals.<br><em></em></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./a-ring-tone-meant-to-fall-on-deaf-ears-new-york-times.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> A Ring Tone Meant to Fall on Deaf Ears - New York Times</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./simcity-takes-over.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> SimCity takes over</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-09-23T13:49" class="feed__date">September 23, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./quality-online.html">Quality online</a></h3></header><p>Chris Horrie has done lots of stuff around journalism, writing and lecturing, and he's also a writer of books including "Stick it up your punter!".
