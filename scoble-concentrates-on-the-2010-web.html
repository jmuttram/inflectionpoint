It’s real time. ("Twitter, Facebook and Friendfeed are all moving toward architectures and displays that refresh in real time, or let you see what’s happening right now. We are at the extreme beginnings of that trend.")<br>2. It’s mobile.<br>3. It’s decentralized. ("Look at my behaviors. I’m all over the place. Six years ago I did only one thing: blog. Now I Flickr. YouTube. Seesmic. Friendfeed. Facebook. Twitter. And many more. Go to <a href="http://www.retaggr.com/Page/scobleizer/">Retaggr</a> and see all the places I’m at.")<br>4. Pages now built out of premade blocks. ("You build these pages by copying a line of Javascript code to your template. This is very simple once you see how to do it, but for someone who doesn’t know code, or where in the template to go, this is VERY daunting. Silicon Valley has NOT made it simple enough yet for the mainstream to build highly useful pages.")<br>5. It’s social. ("This seems obvious to anyone on Twitter or Facebook, but how many businesses add their customers to their pages? Not many. Silicon Valley has done a horrible job so far of explaining why adding people to your websites matters.")<br>6. It’s smart. ("We’re seeing more and more smarts added to the web every day. Tonight Wolfram’s new search engine turned on. Have you played with it? That’s the 2010 web and check out what you can do with it.")<br>7. Hybrid infrastructure. ("When I visited 12seconds.tv in Santa Cruz they told me they were using a hybrid approach: they own a rack of servers but they also use Amazon’s S3 to “cloud burst” or take up the slack for files that are popular.")<br><br>Interesting stuff...<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/mobile" rel="tag">mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/social%20media" rel="tag">social media</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/web" rel="tag">web</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/web2" rel="tag">web2</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/widgets" rel="tag">widgets</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./asymmetric-follow-and-why-its-good-for-you.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Asymmetric follow and why it&#x27;s good for you</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./thoughts-on-the-future-of-journalism.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Thoughts on the future of journalism</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2007-08-16T15:02" class="feed__date">August 16, 2007</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./scoble-takes-a-break.html">Scoble takes a break</a></h3></header><p>Robert Scoble, famous as the (ex-)Microsoft blogger, is taking a break because he is becoming angry and disillusioned by the blogoshere and all that goes with it.
