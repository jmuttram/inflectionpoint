This year there were a fewer people attending and sponsorship seemed a bit thinner on the ground, but otherwise the event was as thought-provoking and enjoyable as ever. It's a bit of a mixed bag, and not all the talks hit the right notes all of the time, but taken as a group I thought the conference was a great success.</p><p></p><p>The theme was designing for tomorrow and there was plenty to think about, even if a lot was quite abstract and had a distinctly US flavour.</p><p></p><p>I'm not going to give a blow by blow account (you can check out the Flickr stream which will give you an impressionistic sense of the event....</p><p><object width="400" height="300"><br><param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fsearch%2Fshow%2F%3Fq%3Ddconstruct%2BOR%2Bdconstruct09%26d%3Dtaken-20090903-%26ss%3D0%26ct%3D0%26mt%3Dphotos%26adv%3D1&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Ddconstruct%2BOR%2Bdconstruct09%26d%3Dtaken-20090903-%26ss%3D0%26ct%3D0%26mt%3Dphotos%26adv%3D1&amp;method=flickr.photos.search&amp;api_params_str=&amp;api_text=dconstruct+OR+dconstruct09&amp;api_tag_mode=bool&amp;api_min_taken_date=2009-09-03+00%3A00%3A00&amp;api_media=photos&amp;api_sort=relevance&amp;jump_to=&amp;start_index=0"><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fsearch%2Fshow%2F%3Fq%3Ddconstruct%2BOR%2Bdconstruct09%26d%3Dtaken-20090903-%26ss%3D0%26ct%3D0%26mt%3Dphotos%26adv%3D1&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Ddconstruct%2BOR%2Bdconstruct09%26d%3Dtaken-20090903-%26ss%3D0%26ct%3D0%26mt%3Dphotos%26adv%3D1&amp;method=flickr.photos.search&amp;api_params_str=&amp;api_text=dconstruct+OR+dconstruct09&amp;api_tag_mode=bool&amp;api_min_taken_date=2009-09-03+00%3A00%3A00&amp;api_media=photos&amp;api_sort=relevance&amp;jump_to=&amp;start_index=0" width="400" height="300"><br></object><br><br>...or the <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23dconstruct09">Twitter stream</a> if you want the real-time experience as see through the eyes of some of the participants (obviously in sound-bites of varying literary quality).<br><br>Here, though, are a few random take-aways from the talks.<br><br><a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/adamgreenfield/">Adam Greenfield, Elements of Networked Urbanism</a><br><br>Everything gets networked, including physical things and that leads to a new trend: from ownership to services - early examples are here already in <a href="http://www.spotify.com/en/">Spotify</a> (subscription, on-demand music) and <a href="http://www.streetcar.co.uk/?kwid=SvCSzJ0Uo&amp;pcrid=3902433712&amp;gclid=CIyLkdnv2ZwCFUxs4wodVBnuKA">Streetcar</a> (pay as you go cars).

Some of the examples given were the <a href="http://labs.digg.com/swarm/">Digg swarm</a> (visualising interest as it builds), <a href="http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/#dtstart=2009-08-22T23:59:59-07:00&amp;dtend=2009-08-29T23:59:59-07:00&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=37.760&amp;types=AA,Mu,Ro,SA,DP,Na,Al,Pr,Th,VT,Va,Bu,Ar&amp;lon=-122.438&amp;hours=7-9,17-19">crime maps</a> (great controls - particularly "commute" and "day and night" as more useful time filters), and <a href="http://stamen.com/clients/msnbc_hurricane_maps">live hurricane activity</a> for MSNBC (great time-based interface). Think about the elegant design to help answer questions people actually want to pose.<br><br><a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/brianfling/">Brian Fling, What's next? How mobile is changing design</a><br><br>Context is key. Design the best possible experience and degrade gracefully, making the best experience possible of each device. Maybe, we'll now start with designing for the mobile and migrate to the desktop, not the other way round (or not at all!). Example: <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/">Tweetie</a> - starts on the iPhone and migrates to the Mac.<br><br><a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/nathanshedroff/">Nathan Shedroff and Chris Noessel, Making it so - learning from Sci-Fi interfaces</a><br><br>Sci-fi borrows from interfaces already invented (Buck Rogers and the video phone which tunes in like a television) and real life borrows from sci-fi - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_StarTAC">StarTAC</a> phone which looks like a communicator from early Star Trek.<br><br><a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/robinhunicke/">Robin Hunicke, Loving your Player with Juicy Feedback</a><br><br>In may ways the most difficult talk as the central notion of "juiciness" was a bit too Californian for the sceptical British audience. However, in many ways I thought the idea of designing in "magic" into the interface to create the kind of emotional connection which games designers seek is a really powerful learning for web design. Why shouldn't b2b website have some of that magic? The power of the Mac and particularly the iPhone comes from the magic of the interface. If we could design some of that into our b2b web sites the results might be amazing - and commercially rewarding.<br><br><a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/augustdelosreyes/">August de los Reyes, Experience the Emotion Commotion</a><br><br>Backing up Robin's talk with "work can be play" and "design for emotion in a world of abundance". The same point above, reinforced. (And showed a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9JBSEBu2q8&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=C0D43A1710D3BB6C&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=39">very cool Microsoft video vision of embedded devices</a>).<br><br><a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/russelldavies/">Russell Davies, Materialising and Dematerialising a web of data</a><br><br>Moving past digital infatuation and analogue nostalgia: "From representing the world on the web to embedding the web in the world". He gives the example of printing newspapers of curated blog content. "There are magnificent bits of infrastructure just lying around" - underused printing presses, a postal system, DVD and CD production facilities and so on. Why not use them to add a dimension to the things that started out on the web? And the best quote of the conference with reference to the newspaper industry: "We've broken your business, now give us your machines".<br><br>So, that's it. Some thoughts about the day - not very coherent but hopefully of some use/interest.<br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./paying-or-not-online.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Paying (or not) online</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-power-of-twitter.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The power of Twitter</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
