The characteristics? personal homepage/profile; personal content creation; the ability to interact with others' content; the ability to befriend and share content. The benefits: heightened customer loyalty; self-policing; amplified by word of mouth; better feedback; stronger and more interesting filters on content.<br><br>Three levels of communities: 1. lightweight social processes (low-barrier social involvement like voting and the recording of personal participation);<br>2. Collaborative information structures (enhanced by social participation); 3. High end end collaboration (groups using systems to make sense and share complex materials)<br><br>Common themes:</p><ul><li>sense of fun and play (the founders very publicly have fun, playful messaging and images on the side)</li><li>keeping the dialogue going ("eating their own dogfood" - "it's amazing how many people don't use their own product", answering your own customer support emails, greeting new customers and introducing them to others - "being the host of a party"</li><li>wouldn't it be awesome if.... (taking an experimental approach to development, throw away the business plan and embrace the chaos, )</li><li>the power of the word of mouth (built-in a variety of ways ot share early on [rss, copy and paste urls etc], adding more on-ramps (email, SMS etc)</li><li>involve community in decisions (listen to your users and be flexible, let the community create the content and make the decisions)</li><li>simple platform to build on (building blocks - tools built be experts but used by non-experts eg. Wordpress [users add extensions] Flickr api, focus on one function well</li><li>Compelling stories</li><li>rewarding of community members (feature super users, more privileges)</li></ul><p>There are four characteristics of successful communities that she identifies:<br>Feelings of membership (creation of community boundaries, perception of emotional safety) Personal profile pages, allowing for lots of personal and group expression.<br>Feelings of influence (being able to influence the group, feedback responsiveness, rule enforcement) Include forums, chat, comments etc<br>Integration and fulfillment of needs (feeling of being supported by others, reward of being and member, such as status, shared values, feeling of competence) Karma points etc<br>Shared emotional connection (personal investment of time and resources, high quality, frequent interaction) Add face-to-face opportunities<br>The bottom line: building communities is hard work and can take a long time to build.<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/FOWAlondon07" rel="tag">FOWAlondon07</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./apollo-the-next-big-thing.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Apollo -
