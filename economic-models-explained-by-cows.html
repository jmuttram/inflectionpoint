I've read many of the definitions, with some slight variations, but this is the most complete list I've seen. Not very PC, but funny, none-the-less....<br><br>SOCIALISM<br>You have 2 cows. You give one to your neighbour.<br><br>COMMUNISM<br>You have 2 cows. The State takes both and gives you some milk.<br><br>FASCISM<br>You have 2 cows. The State takes both and sells you some milk.<br><br>NAZISM<br>You have 2 cows. The State takes both and shoots you.<br><br>BUREAUCRATISM<br>You have 2 cows. The State takes both, shoots one, milks the other, and then throws the<br>milk away...<br><br>TRADITIONAL CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.<br><br>SURREALISM<br>You have two giraffes. The government requires you to take harmonica lessons<br><br>AMERICAN CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You sell one, and force the other to produce the milk of four cows. Later, you hire a consultant to analyse why the cow has dropped dead.<br><br>ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a<br>debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island Company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to our listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. You sell one cow to buy a new president of the United States, leaving you with nine cows. No balance sheet provided with the release. The public then buys your bull.<br><br>THE ANDERSEN MODEL<br>You have two cows. You shred them.<br><br>FRENCH CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You go on strike, organise a riot, and block the roads, because you want three cows.<br><br>JAPANESE CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. You then create a clever cow cartoon image called 'Cowkimon' and market it worldwide.<br><br>GERMAN CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You re-engineer them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and milk themselves.<br><br>ITALIAN CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows, but you don't know where they are. You decide to have lunch.<br><br>RUSSIAN CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 2 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka.<br><br>SWISS CAPITALISM<br>You have 5000 cows. None of them belong to you. You charge the owners for storing them.<br><br>CHINESE CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You have 300 people milking them. You claim that you have full employment, and high bovine productivity. You arrest the newsman who reported the real situation.<br><br>INDIAN CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. You worship them.<br><br>BRITISH CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. Both are mad.<br><br>IRAQI CAPITALISM<br>Everyone thinks you have lots of cows. You tell them that you have none. No-one believes you, so they bomb the **** out of you and invade your<br>country. You still have no cows, but at least now you are part of a Democracy....<br><br>NEW ZEALAND CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. The one on the left looks very attractive.<br><br>AUSTRALIAN CAPITALISM<br>You have two cows. Business seems pretty good. You close the office and go for a few beers to celebrate<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/humour" rel="tag">humour</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./keeping-good-people.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Keeping good people</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./fast-buys-cool-new-technology.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Fast buys cool new technology</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-02-02T16:36" class="feed__date">February 2, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./advice-on-web-business-models.html">Advice on web business models</a></h3></header><p>There's a great post by Fred Wilson, a New York-based VC, who writes about internet business models.
