It was talking about the growth of mobile advertising at Facebook and Twitter.</p><div></div><div>The fact that stood out for me was that fully 18% of Facebook's ad revenue was now from mobile advertising, up from 0% in <b>under a year</b>. And the proportion was expected to grow to 40% this year. Twitter already has more revenue from mobile.<div></div><div>[The figures come from eMarketer but sadly I can't share them as they are behind a pay wall and our corporate subscription seems to have expired.]</div><div></div><div>There was a lot of negative talk about the prospects for mobile advertising but the fact is that customers of both sites seem to have taken the ads in their stride.&nbsp;</div></div><div></div><div>In both Facebook and Twitter the ads take the form of posts which are placed in the news stream. They are clearly labelled - as "promoted tweets" on Twitter and "suggested posts" on Facebook - but they slot easily into the stream and don't disrupt the reading experience.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I've no idea whether these new ads have a better response rate than conventional banners, buttons, overlays and the rest - maybe someone can supply the data? &nbsp;But somehow this seems like a much better approach to getting the message across than the increasingly desperate ways of interrupting the flow of concentration which seem to be very much the norm now online.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The user experience of browsing through a "river" of feeds on Facebook or Twitter is not jarred of broken by the arrival of promoted/suggested content - you can take it or leave it just as you can the posts themselves (although using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131834970288134/">Facebook's precise targeting</a> the chances of relevance should be high.)&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>If the response rates are acceptable &nbsp;(particularly if the relevance targeting gets better and better)&nbsp;<span style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);">advertisers&nbsp;</span>and the sites themselves should resist the temptation to try to make them stand out in the bad old ways. Comfortable co-existence, which has never been the case online, is by far the best long term solution. And the figures certainly seem to support this.&nbsp;</div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./computer-heal-thyself.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Computer heal thyself</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./abc-of-metrics.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> ABC of metrics</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-03-27T14:10" class="feed__date">March 27, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./how-to-organise-a-party-with-twitter.html">How to organise a party with Twitter</a></h3></header><p>Interesting post from Robert Scoble explaining how he and a couple of friends organised a party in under 30 hours using only Twitter.
