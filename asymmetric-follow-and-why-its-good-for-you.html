He calls this "asymmetric follow" or "Twitter-mode". This ability is one of the key advantages that Twitter has over other networks like Facebook and Dopplr which require you to response to friend requests in order to grow the network.<br><br></p><blockquote>With Twitter’s model, I can find people I’m interested in, whether or not they know me, and learn about them and their lives and thoughts. Others can include me in their lists. You become “friends” with complete strangers over time, by communicating with them (responding with @messages for example), perhaps by mutual following. In fact, Twitter’s wonderful system of @ messages means that anyone can address me - and so I find myself having conversations with complete strangers as well. I actually follow my @ messages more faithfully than I do my planned Follow list.</blockquote><p>His advice to all social networks: "even if you have your own ideas about how to organize social networks, have an option for users to turn on 'Twitter-mode'. I think you’d be surprised how well it works."<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Facebook" rel="tag">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/social%20media" rel="tag">social media</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/twitter" rel="tag">twitter</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./comments-why-they-dont-work-and-how-to-fix-things.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Comments - why they don&#x27;t work and how to fix things</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./scoble-concentrates-on-the-2010-web.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Scoble concentrates on the 2010 web</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2023-04-03T20:15" class="feed__date">April 3, 2023</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./i-asked-chatgpt-to-list-10-good-and-bad-things-about-llms.html">I asked ChatGPT to list 10 good and bad things about LLMs</a></h3></header><p>Here are 10 ways in which large language models such as myself could provide real benefit to the world: Here are 10 ways in which large language models could have a detrimental effect: Interesting......</p><a href="./i-asked-chatgpt-to-list-10-good-and-bad-things-about-llms.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2018-10-01T10:04" class="feed__date">October 1, 2018</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./elon-musk-good-news-or-bad-news.html">Elon Musk: good news or bad news?</a></h3></header><p>The outcome of the SEC investigation into Elon Musk's wayward tweet on taking Tesla private could turn out to be either very good, or very bad.
