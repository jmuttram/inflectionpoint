The newspaper building is old, a little worn, the founder's picture is on the wall. The interactive organisation is in Arlington in a steel and glass building. However, she says, there is a lot of interaction - several video conferences between the news teams each day. However, "we still step on each other's toes." Culturally though they are learning how to evolve - particularly where there is a need to cover things immediately rather than wait and consider.<br><br>Another question on interaction. "We've only had to shut down our comments once". She says people want to shout at the Washtington Post more than each other.<br><br>She also says there is now a lot more "reverse publishing" - blogs written by journalists which then make it into print.<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/AOP%2007" rel="tag">AOP 07</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./washington-post-local-and-international.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Washington Post - local and international</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./meet-the-aggregators.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Meet the aggregators</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-01-22T21:28" class="feed__date">January 22, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./newsroom-questions-answered.html">Newsroom questions answered</a></h3></header><p>Looking to find out what editors-in-chief of the world’s newspapers think about the rapidly changing media landscape?
