Sites such as MySpace and Facebook will add mobile users to their business model, and similar services will gain popularity with professionals and older users.Mobile TV. It's just now making its first entries into the mobile device market, but it will become a primary driver of revenues.</li><li>Cheaper and more flexible multifunction devices. Look for 3G devices but with more functionality, higher speeds, and prices below $99.</li><li>GPS will become the location technology that the wireless industry actually uses in 2007. While many phones already have GPS support, applications that use that capability will blossom.</li><li>Internet Big Names will play a major role in IP Multimedia Services for mobile devices. An inCode study found that while these services haven't taken off as expected, this may be because users don't understand what they do. Expect to see names like Yahoo and Google on your mobile device.</li><li>China and India will become the hot mobile device markets, and as a result, mobile devices and services will focus on those markets first, rather than the United States and Europe as in the past.</li><li>Mobile advertising will boom. Be prepared for ads with your text messages and elsewhere on your 3G phone, targeted just for you.</li><li>Home entertainment will become part of the wireless world. This will include music and video downloads over both high-speed data connections and Wi-Fi. You will be able to play music, watch television or meet other data communications needs with your wireless device. This will be especially important in emerging markets, according to inCode.</li><li>Users realize that security is important. 2007 may be the year that hackers really make a move on the mobile device universe. Virus attacks, data loss and theft will become major concerns, and companies will finally need to pay attention to the risks from mobile devices.</li><li>Enterprises will embrace mobility. Companies will incorporate mobile devices throughout the corporation and will start to depend on wireless access to data as a routine practice. Some companies may completely replace their wired telephone infrastructure with wireless devices.</li></ul><p></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/mobile" rel="tag">mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/predictions" rel="tag">predictions</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./youtube-to-share-ad-revenue.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> YouTube to share ad revenue</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./clinton-uses-yahoo-to-get-to-the-people.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Clinton uses Yahoo! to get to the people</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-07-28T05:12" class="feed__date">July 28, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./internet-ads-continue-to-rise.html">Internet ads continue to rise</a></h3></header><p>Online advertising spending is set to grow 25 per cent worldwide in 2006 says a report from Carat, quoted by the AOP.
