The problem was that, though they were getting quite popular, they didn't have an obvious business model and without revenue, it was argued, they had no future.<div>Of course, as things panned out LinkedIn discovered a revenue stream in recruitment head-hunting, got really big and then added lots of other ways to make money including lead generation. Few today can ignore LinkedIn as a power-house of social media.<br>The same was also true of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> - which used to be associated only with students comparing notes on parties and sexual partners, and where the only revenue seemed to come from people buying each other virtual gifts.<br>The news that Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/amazon-now-taps-into-facebook-for-social-product-recommendations/" target="_blank">linked up with Facebook for social recommendations</a> suddenly changes the picture. Of course Facebook was already making money from advertising (in fact is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hi33tCMumqOZex_Jjdv9WLaoIDOg" target="_blank">the largest display advertising site</a> in the world now). But the direct link to ecommerce points the way to real monetisation of the 500 million customers the site now has.<br>All this has prompted Google to <a href="http://www.utalkmarketing.com/pages/Article.aspx?ArticleID=18576&amp;Title=Google_searches_for_new_ways_to_sell_user_data_to_advertisers" target="_blank">re-think its privacy policy</a> and <a href="http://www.onlinesocialmedia.net/20100811/google-latest-social-chest-move-buys-jambool/" target="_blank">beef up its social efforts</a> as it tries to find ways to compete - it now has Microsoft and Facebook as its twin rivals.<br>There is real value in being the biggest even if it isn't always obvious where the money is coming from early on. And there is real danger in focusing too narrowly on the business model before you have the audience to support it. Being broad minded and playing the long game - provided you have the funding to afford to - does pay off.</div><div style="font-size: 10px;"><a href="http://posterous.com/">Posted via email</a> from <a href="http://muttram.com/the-power-of-big-tags-google-facebook-linkedi">Inflection Point v2</a></div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./personal-domain-site-up-and-running.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Personal domain site up and running</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-great-paywall-experiment.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Great Paywall Experiment</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2017-11-09T17:54" class="feed__date">November 9, 2017</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./ai-powered-robots-and-the-future.html">AI-powered robots and the future</a></h3></header><p>This is a post over which I have been pondering for quite a while.
