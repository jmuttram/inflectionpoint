I started it, unbelievably, <a href="http://bloggingrbi.blogspot.com/2005/08/welcome.html">in September 2005</a> just ahead of the RBI Editor's Conference on the 22nd. The original purpose was to illustrate a point: that self-publishing using blogging software was powerful, was here to stay, and was a significant threat or opportunity to our journalists.<br><br>It was great fun blogging the event in real time and I think it made its point.<br><br>Afterwards, though, I decided to keep the blog on and change it's purpose a bit. That purpose is written in the sub-heading: "charting the road from paper to digital publishing". What I have tried to do, with mixed success I suspect, (and certainly at times with erratic effort) is to highlight in short posts what I consider to be significant developments which will have some kind of impact on the journalists and editors of RBI (and other b2b publishers).<br><br>Over the past three and a bit years the technology of the web has changed a great deal and for a long while I have been using <a href="http://reader.google.coom/">Google Reader </a>as way of keeping up with events and I found the "share items" functionality an incredibly useful way to very rapidly create lists of linked posts which I think of as important or noteworthy. Mostly I do this as I don't have much more to say in a blog post on the subject, though sometimes it is just to save time, as the amount of ground asking to be covered grows and grows.<br><br>Lately I've also been trying out <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and have started to use this as a way of highlighting interesting posts or web pages and I now find I'm in a bit of a dilemma. Do I start using Twitter alone? Do I use Google Reader alone? Do I use a combination? In reality I will use both for some time to come, I think, as they are both useful but in different ways, even though the result with be fragmentation of a kind.<br><br>I think now the blog has outgrown its original purpose; there are now a large number of my colleagues much more knowledgeable about the web than me and so there is little point in me trying to continue to post in the way I have in the past.<br><br>So from now on I'm going to use the blog to post longer pieces on the implications of what I see happening in the technology space and I'll rely on Google Reader and Twitter to create bread-crumbs pointing to the sites or posts which some may find interesting or relevant.<br><br>I'm going to broaden the scope out slightly, too, to encompass changes in the social and corporate landscape which are being wrought by the changing technology (looking back, I post about this quite a bit already, so I may as well come clean!)<br><br>I've already rung the changes with a simpler, cleaner new look and I'll be looking for ways to improve usability and functionality in the future.<br><br>Anyway, hope you enjoy reading the blog as it develops in 2009 and a happy New Year to one and all.<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/blogs" rel="tag">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/2009" rel="tag">2009</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./twitter-as-a-polling-mechanism.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1238/responsive/twitpoll2-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="442" width="442"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Twitter as a polling mechanism</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./end-of-an-era.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> End of an era?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-04-02T18:32" class="feed__date">April 2, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./downing-street-has-started-twittering.html">Downing Street has started Twittering...</a></h3></header><p>...if you are an aficionado you can follow them here.
