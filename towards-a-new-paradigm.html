But a discrete and serial series of articles over days cannot adequately cover the complex stories going on now nor can they properly inform the public. There’s too much repetition. Too little explanation.</blockquote><p>Instead:<br><br></p><blockquote>... I want a page, a site, a thing that is created, curated, edited, and discussed. It’s a blog that treats a topic as an ongoing and cumulative process of learning, digging, correcting, asking, answering. It’s also a wiki that keeps a snapshot of the latest knowledge and background. It’s an aggregator that provides annotated links to experts, coverage, opinion, perspective, source material. It’s a discussion that doesn’t just blather but that tries to accomplish something (an extension of an article like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30alternatives.html?ref=business">this one</a> that asks what options there are to bailout a bailout). It’s collaborative and distributed and open but organized.</blockquote><p>In response to the huge complexities and fast past of the economic crisis, will we see a new form emerge? I actually think one of our blogs, <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/flightblogger">Flightblogger</a>, is already doing something like this for the 787 programme - he's mixing the fast (Twitter) with the slow and reflective (old-fashioned feature articles) and pulling it together in one place. What's probably missing is easy access to "the story so far".<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/internet" rel="tag">internet</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/journalism" rel="tag">journalism</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/media" rel="tag">media</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./what-happened-to-digg.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> What happened to Digg?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./in-difficult-times.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> In difficult times...</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
