Teslas are built in Freemont, California and travel by train to the port at Houston, Texas.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On April 30th I thought I ought to get ready so I drove to the service centre at Dartford to buy a Tesla Wall Connector (they are not chargers and technically the charging is done in the car) and a thing called a Chademo adapter which is needed to connect to Chademo rapid chargers (the only thing available near where I needed it in North Norfolk).</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-1829"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/1433/wall-charger-scaled.jpeg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1433/responsive/wall-charger-scaled-xs.jpeg 640w, ./media/posts/1433/responsive/wall-charger-scaled-sm.jpeg 768w, ./media/posts/1433/responsive/wall-charger-scaled-md.jpeg 1024w, ./media/posts/1433/responsive/wall-charger-scaled-lg.jpeg 1366w, ./media/posts/1433/responsive/wall-charger-scaled-xl.jpeg 1600w, ./media/posts/1433/responsive/wall-charger-scaled-2xl.jpeg 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>On May 7th I got the notification that my car was on the ship bound for Tilburg and after what seemed an age, on May 25th the app informed me the car was finally at Tilburg in the Netherlands ready for reassembly and then transport by car transporter to Dartford.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On Monday June 10th I finally got the word that the car could be picked up the following Friday.</p><p></p><p></p><p>All did not go to plan on Friday....</p><p></p><p></p><p>I arrived as agreed at 11.30am for my pick-up and hand-over only to find that they weren't expecting me until the following week. There had apparently been a mix up in communications but the staff were excellent and located the car (stored at Blue Water) and said they could get it ready by 4pm if I was happy to come back, which I was.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I intended to leave just after 3pm to make sure I was in plenty of time, but I had a call about 2.45pm saying there was a large diesel spillage on the M25 and the Dartford tunnel was closed as a result and that traffic would be worse than usual so I should leave now.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It took me over three hours to go 20 miles, the last hour within a mile of the service centre. But the hand-over staff stayed behind in an otherwise deserted building and I finally picked up my car at about 6.30pm.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I should have had a leisurely hand-over and had everything explained to me but with no time it was just a question of getting in and driving off.
