And I must say we are all hooked. I love the way that the 70s series has been re-worked in the mid-noughties.</p><p></p><p>The ships and the space special effects are updated to appeal to an audience used to high-quality fabrication. But I love the way the essentials of the social fabric and the more mundane technology - writing implements, telephones, food and drink etc - have been frozen as they were imagined in the 70s. (The one thing that seems to have changed out of all recognition, for some inexplicable reason, is the playing cards.)</p><p></p><p>As a consequence they say as much about the 70s as they do about the future - more actually. So, smoking is a common pastime, drinks are served in glass and people are contacted by being called across to old-fashioned telephone handsets (mobile phones were nowhere to be seen in the 70s). And paper and pencils are still very much state of the art.</p><p></p><p>I was reminded of the <a href="http://2009.dconstruct.org/schedule/nathanshedroff/">presentation at d.construct this year</a> by Nathan Shedroff and Chris Noessel which argued that design in Sci-Fi was absolutely conditioned by the norms of the time it was written.
