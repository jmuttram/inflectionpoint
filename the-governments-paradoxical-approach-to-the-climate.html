The coalition government is hell bent on promoting fracking in the UK as aggressively as they can - probably keen to emulate the energy revolution which has happened in the US.</p><p>But it has become clear that the last thing the world needs is more fossil fuels. If we are keep warming to 2C - a target that world leaders are still ostensibly signed up to - then <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says">it is now recognised</a> that a large proportion of extractable fossil fuels will need to be left in the ground. Actually, the figures are 82% of all coal, 49% of all gas and 33% of all oil.</p><p>So, if the Prime Minister is genuinely simultaneously signed up for action on climate change <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> developing fracking it must mean only one thing - he thinks we can boost our fossil fuel production while expecting others to do the heavy lifting. Given the fraught nature of international climate politics, that doesn't sound like a realistic position.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/climate-change-2/">Climate Change</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-breaking-of-glass.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The breaking of Glass?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./more-resilient-cities.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> More Resilient Cities</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2018-10-08T11:40" class="feed__date">October 8, 2018</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./climate-disaster-and-how-to-avoid-it.html">Climate disaster and how to avoid it</a></h3></header><p>Today the IPCC came out with its sternest warning yet about the dangers the world faces if global warming isn't held to 1.5degC.
