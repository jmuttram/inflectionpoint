The other is the resurgence of a confident Apple, powered by innovative new products - the iPod and iPhone - and great new designs.

I had to go round the various computers in the house to add the long string of characters. On the Mac there's a check box which allows you to show the characters (instead of just ****) while you type. This is incredibly useful as you can check the string to make sure it's right (before unchecking the box again). Next I repeated the operation for the XP machines. No such option - and several goes to get the typing right! Our new Vista machine was a breeze, however. Guess what? The same treatment as the Mac. That's progress.<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/computing" rel="tag">computing</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Microsoft" rel="tag">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Vista" rel="tag">Vista</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./go-forth-and-blog-young-man.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Go forth and blog, young man</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./ugc-makes-it-to-print.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> UGC makes it to print</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-05-11T02:49" class="feed__date">May 11, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./rentathing-portable-reputation.html">RentAThing - portable reputation</a></h3></header><p>Steve Rubel reports on a Portable Reputation Management System called RentAThing which aims to do for real life what eBay has done for online auctions.
