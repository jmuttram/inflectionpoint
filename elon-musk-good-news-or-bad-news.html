The instruction to hire an independent chairman to oversee Musk is the crucial condition. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Tech company founders have often found themselves in need of outside experience to lead once their enterprises reach a certain size . Those who can make the product, seldom have the characteristics or experience to morph into successful managers of much larger enterprises. </p><p></p><p></p><p>The best example of this working well was Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/at-google-eric-schmidt-wrote-the-book-on-adult-supervision/">hire Eric Schmidt</a> to front up their rapidly growing company in 1998. It was the persistence of their VC backers which led them to find Schmidt eventually and the arrangement worked like a dream. </p><p></p><p></p><p>However, there are several reasons why a similar successful outcome may be harder for Musk to pull off, and these are two of the major ones:</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Time</h4><p></p><p></p><p>The SEC has given Tesla 45 days for Musk to resign the chairman's role, not a lot of time for such a tricky and sensitive search, especially so since it is unlikely Musk has spent any time thinking about what wants or needs from such a relationship. </p><p></p><p></p><h4>Temperament</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Musk has a towering self-belief which seems to cover just about every walk of life - extra-terrestrial colonisation, combatting climate change, rescuing children from flooded underground tunnels. It is perhaps unlikely that he recognises the possible benefits which would accrue from a wiser corporate head, experienced in the ways of public companies. </p><p></p><p></p><p>It would be very good for the world if a Schmidt-like outcome occurred. Whether it can or not remains to be seen. </p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/business/">Business</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./climate-change-too-true-to-be-good.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Climate Change: too true to be good</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./remaking-post-industrial-cities.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Remaking Post-Industrial Cities</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-12-26T17:11" class="feed__date">December 26, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./prescription-for-a-digital-future-for-news.html">Prescription for a digital future for news</a></h3></header><p>Edward Roussel of the Telegraph has a long post outlining the challenges he sees facing newspapers today and some suggestions about how to tackle them, including a 10 point plan.
