However, in the last six months my usage of Reader to keep up with events had virtually stopped. My "web radar" these days is definitely Twitter.</p><p></p><p>I used to worry that I was missing a lot by relying on Twitter. But on the occasions when I did devote the time to ploughing through my thousands of accumulated posts on Google Reader, I seldom found anything I found I didn't already know about.</p><p></p><p>I must say I'm a bit surprised to find how central Twitter has become - I wasn't really aware of it.
