The group earlier this month reported unique visitors to newspaper sites rose 31 percent during the first half of 2006 over the same period in ‘05. Unique visitors to paper sites averaged more than 55.5 million per month during the first six months of ‘06, up almost a third from the 42.4 million during the first half of last year. Newspaper sites generated 2.7 billion pageviews in the third quarter, and visitors spent more than 41.5 minutes each month on the sites, according to the report. During that period last year, visitors viewed around 1.9 billion paper pages, spending 40.4 minutes on the sites on average monthly.</p></blockquote><p>But, he says, this is not good news.</p><blockquote><p>I think this further feeds the idea that newspapers are in “<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/10/30/your-customers-are-ahead-of-you/buzzmachine">free fall</a>,” as The Times said last week: The rush online is getting faster and faster and if media execs and ad execs don’t catch up, they will be left behind… sooner than they think.</p><p>I call out ad execs for a reason: They are holding back the progress in media.</p></blockquote><p>Unless they get their act together, he argues, they will lose the market. There's a lesson here for all of us, I suspect.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./engagement-the-new-black.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Engagement - the new black</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./google-to-beef-up-ad-options.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Google to beef up ad options?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-05-22T05:54" class="feed__date">May 22, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./buffett-newspapers-are-a-business-in-permanent-decline.html">Buffett: Newspapers are &quot;a business in permanent decline&quot;</a></h3></header><p>Warren Buffet's views on the future of US newspapers.
