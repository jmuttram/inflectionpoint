The figure for the last complete year, 2017-2018, was 149.</p><p>Is this number high? Well, Amazon says it has 25,000 people employed in the UK and the Health and Safety Executive says the average non-fatal accident rate in the warehousing and transportation support industries category in 2016-2017 was 1,577 per 100,000 workers.</p><p>Assuming the rate has stayed about the same the following year, for Amazon to have had an average accident rate it would have recorded 394 accidents. So on these data you could say Amazon is a substantially better than average performer on accidents.</p><p>The BBC story quotes the GMB saying : "the actual numbers were probably higher, because some local authorities were unable to provide details of incident reports."</p><p>That may well be so, but frankly they could be double and it still would not be much of a story.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/internet-economy/">Internet Economy</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./climate-disaster-and-how-to-avoid-it.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Climate disaster and how to avoid it</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./incoherence-in-government.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Incoherence in Government</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-03-28T19:39" class="feed__date">March 28, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-thought-behind-amazons-reviews.html">The thought behind Amazon&#x27;s reviews</a></h3></header><p>A great article from The Silicon Valley Insider uncovers the secrets of Amazon's approach to customer reviews.
