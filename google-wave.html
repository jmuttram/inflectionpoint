The first problem you encounter when you receive your coveted email invitation is finding anyone else who's got an account that you want to communicate with. In my case, I found that were quite a few of my colleagues with accounts and we quickly hooked up in an experimental wave.</p><p></p><p>The interface is reasonable, if a little complicated, until you get used to it, and the way it incorporates real-time chat into "email" is really impressive at first - until you realise that everyone in the wave can see your appalling typing and corrections as they happens. That can be painful.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem, though, is maintaining the momentum. Most of our communication takes place in email or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (sometimes through Twitter) and the challenge Google will have to overcome - and it's a big one - is inertia. How to get large swathes of people to transfer their time and attention to Wave when they already have to check email, Twitter, <a href="http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> etc.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, it's early days and very few people are allowed to use the system. The acid test will be when it is open to all. When Google launched Gmail the product took off very rapidly because it was a superior email client, and crucially because it was interoperable with what had gone before.</p><p></p><p>Wave however is not interoperable with email. Can Google change the habits of the populace at large? I'm not so sure.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-power-of-twitter.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The power of Twitter</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-future-of-social-media.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The future of social media</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-05-08T05:54" class="feed__date">May 8, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./whats-google-been-doing.html">What&#x27;s Google been doing?</a></h3></header><p>It's Sergey Brin's turn to write the annual Google Founders Letter, a traditional part of Google's annual report.
