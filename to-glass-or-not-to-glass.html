The product was shown initially at the I/O conference in June 2012 and the first beta products (knows as the Explorer Edition) were made available to a select group of evangelists who paid $1,500 for the privilege in April 2013. Since then they have made all sorts outings on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rackspaces-ceo-lanham-napier-wearing-google-glass-2013-6">various conference stages</a> around the world, been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/21/sergey-brin-google-glass-new-york-subway">photographed in the New York subway</a>&nbsp;and even been photographed in the shower (see photo of Robert Scoble).There have been endless reviews from the "explorers" such as<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/30/google-glass-review/"> this</a> or <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/google-glass-review/30300/">this</a>.<br><br>On the whole the tenor has been - revolutionary product, will take some getting used to but generally positive. Lately, though the tone has changed. Gizmodo <a href="http://gizmodo.com/googles-getting-defensive-about-glass-1548371476">calls out Google</a> for getting defensive but not answering the real issues. And Mashable weighed in with its prediction that Android smart watches (specifically the Moto 360) will render Glass obsolete:<a href="http://mashable.com/2014/03/20/moto-360-vs-google-glass/">Why the Moto 360 Smartwatch will Kill Google Glass.</a><br><br><a href="./media/posts/1367/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="./media/posts/1367/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower.jpg" height="240" width="320" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a>I think this new-found pessimism is wrong on a number of counts. It is easier to see how a smart watch would be used - we already have watches and if it gives us a bit of what our phones give us we can get our heads round that.<br><br>But that is to miss the basic point. We are all now inseparable from the web. We use the internet as external memory and our smart phones are our current access point. But they are far from perfect - staring at your phone screen distracts from the task in hand and acts as a barrier to the real world. Smart watches will be better, but only just.<br><br>The real end-game is seamless access to the web directly overlaid on the world. Google Glass is the closest thing we have to that right now.<br><br>Sure, Glass is flawed (poor battery life, limited applications etc etc) and certainly it will take us a while to work out the correct etiquette around it.<br><br>But the Glass paradigm is a powerful one which is qualitatively different to all that has gone before it. And Moore's law should take care of the shortcomings.<br><br>This <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/12/glasshole/">summary from Wired</a> is a pretty good round up of both the good and the bad. The conclusion is, I think, right on the money:<br><br></p><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 20px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can make fun of Glass, and the assholes (like me) who wear it. But here’s what I know: The future is on its way, and it is going to be on your face. We need to think about it and be ready for it in a way we weren’t with smartphones. Because while you (and I) may make fun of glassholes today, come tomorrow we’re all going to be right there with them, or at least very close by. Wearables are where we’re going. Let’s be ready.</span></span></blockquote></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/internet-economy/">Internet Economy</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./is-yahoos-move-the-first-of-many.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Is Yahoo&#x27;s move the first of many?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./bringing-internet-access-to-the-world.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Bringing internet access to the world</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2014-11-18T16:52" class="feed__date">November 18, 2014</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-breaking-of-glass.html">The breaking of Glass?</a></h3></header><p>Techcrunch is predicting the demise of Google Glass as a consumer product, citing departing developers and a perceived lack of support from the top of Google.
