It became a big obsession with both of them, rivalling even Pokemon and I got to know Games Workshop well.</p><p>I spoke to colleagues at work and unless they also had boys of a similar age they were oblivious to the whole phenomenon.</p><p>These Warhammer characters were not cheap and the rules of game were so obtuse that it was amazing so many teenage boys became so hooked (or maybe not, knowing teenage boys).</p><p>Anyway, I figured this was an interesting business model so I bought a few shares. Today the company was featured in The Economist as the best performing stock in the FTSE 250.</p><p>I may have had to wait 15 years, but I can really pick a stock - this one has risen by over 526%.</p><figure class="size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/1426/image_560542887359476.jpg" height="3000" width="1875" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1426/responsive/image_560542887359476-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1426/responsive/image_560542887359476-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1426/responsive/image_560542887359476-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1426/responsive/image_560542887359476-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1426/responsive/image_560542887359476-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1426/responsive/image_560542887359476-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/business/">Business</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./remaking-post-industrial-cities.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Remaking Post-Industrial Cities</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./climate-disaster-and-how-to-avoid-it.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Climate disaster and how to avoid it</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
