It’s a perfect answer to the following ‘killer’ questions “Why do we blog? What’s in it for us as a company? Why should RBI treat the internet and blogging so seriously?”<br><br>Peter Clifton: “We’ve obviously moved on from the times when we pronounced from the mountain top what had happened and everybody had to sit at home and listen and watch and take it as read. Now our audience is very heavily involved in our news reporting so on any particular day people will e-mail us about what they know about a story we’re covering but on a very big occasion like July 7th or the current hurricanes that are going on, people are e-mailing us with pictures, with their eye-witness accounts, with videos—that becomes a central part of our coverage. It isn’t just something that we have around the periphery and it’s of passing interest. A lot of these images and comments and experiences are ones we’d never gather any other way.”<br><br>Phi Glover responded: “It all gives quite a lot of power to the consumer though doesn’t it? And you could equally say it enables us to have more choice but it would enable other people to put out more propaganda—you don’t always know what it is that you’re reading.”<br><br>Peter Clifton replied: “One of the main challenges for us as a site is the sheer volume of material that we get sent in. And if we’re going to make use of it within our news reporting and we want to share images, videos, text with other part of BBC news it’s a key part of our job to verify it before we do that. I think over time we’ll see within our site and many others we’ll see a much greater emphasis on the role the people out there—the readers---can play in our reporting. I think they’ll be more places on our site where you’ll be able to read a citizen’s view of what’s happened, their pictures their videos, I think the scale of it will only increase.<br><br>I think we’ll need to find a better way of representing it on our site---being more up front about our desire to have the input of the user and the BBC should aim to be over the next few years THE place where people go when they want to involve themselves in the coverage of the news. We’re seeing a fantastic start to that---but it’s only just the beginning.”<br><br>Take that last sentence. Change BBC to RBI and what have you got? The reason why we’re getting into the internet and blogging! Even a battle-wearing old warhorse like me can see that it’s the future for business-to-business coverage whereby we can enlist the firepower of thousands of correspondents around the world and leverage their inside-knowledge, their experience, their street-credibility. I can see this is the future. Can everyone else?</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./citizen-journalism-2.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Citizen journalism</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./citizen-journalism.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Citizen Journalism</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-08-12T10:58" class="feed__date">August 12, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./steve-rubel-reveals-his-4-hour-a-day-blogging-playbook.html">Steve Rubel reveals his 4-hour a day blogging playbook</a></h3></header><p>BlogWrite for CEOs has a post on how Steve Rubel, the author of the Micro Persuasion blog, one of the largest on the web, fits in prolific posting with his day job as a PR.</p><a href="./steve-rubel-reveals-his-4-hour-a-day-blogging-playbook.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-08-13T19:17" class="feed__date">August 13, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./credibility-in-blogging-and-journalism.html">Credibility in blogging and journalism</a></h3></header><p>Between the Lines has an interesting discussion of fact-checking and its relationship to the debate about the difference between bloggers and journalists.</p><a href="./credibility-in-blogging-and-journalism.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-08-14T20:47" class="feed__date">August 14, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./hill-and-knowlton-gets-blogging.html">Hill &amp; Knowlton gets blogging</a></h3></header><p>Hill & Knowlton, the PR giant, has announced an effort to get the firm blogging.</p><a href="./hill-and-knowlton-gets-blogging.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
