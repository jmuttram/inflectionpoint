But they suffer from a common problem. When journalists cover energy related subjects - say the trials and tribulations of the North Sea oil industry or fracking or Alberta coal tar sands - they do so in isolation, without mentioning the Elephant in the Room - the carbon budget. This basically means most of even the oil and gas on the energy companies' books can't be burned if we are to stay below 2 degrees C of warming.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not to say The Guardian doesn't do a good job of reporting on the Elephant itself; it does. It's just that the Elephant often doesn't get a look in when other, related topics are covered.&nbsp;</p><p>And, in my opinion, it's a good idea to keep your eye on the Elephant at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>Alan Rusbridger has said that the one thing he wishes he had done a better job of in his time as editor is cover Climate Change better. Here's hoping this means the Elephant gets a look in much more in the future.&nbsp;</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/climate-change-2/">Climate Change</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-soulful-organisation.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Soulful Organisation</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-climate-change-narrative.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The climate change narrative </div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2015-03-09T10:31" class="feed__date">March 9, 2015</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./ignoring-the-elephant.html">Ignoring the Elephant</a></h3></header><p>Over the weekend I wrote a post called The Elephant in the Room where I talked about the tendency of journalists to ignore the issue of climate change when reporting energy stories.
