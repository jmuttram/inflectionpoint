Build great platforms. I first heard this insight being persausively argued in Mark Zuckerberg's interview with John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly at Web 2.0 in 2010 - an age ago in internet time. </span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=CRUOl03nZIc#t=2117">In this clip</a> he tells how he urges his people to "be fast and be bold". He then talks about what it means to be agile. While small start-ups can do it easily, the larger you get the harder it is to move fast. But, he says, people can move quickly on top of a robust platform built on "solid abstractions". </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">I also remember being impressed with the speed that Yahoo! teams were able to build strong features on the back of solid APIs to things like single sign-on, maps and Flickr photos. Because the APIs are easily internally available, teams are able to function on the innovation rather than the plumbing. </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Amazon is perhaps the supreme example of a company build on the power of the platform. Jeff Bezos has built a platform which can quickly turn its hand to selling just about anything. There was an <a href="http://siliconangle.com/furrier/2011/10/12/google-engineer-accidently-shares-his-internal-memo-about-google-platform/">accidental post by a Google engineer</a> <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 21px;">Steve Yegge</span><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 21px;"> </span>which famously demonstrated the pain it took getting there, but there is no doubt that the platform approach is one of the main underpinnings of Amazon's huge success. That same post argued that Google was, incidentally, some way away from the ideal which illustrates eloquently just how hard it is to get it right. </span><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/internet-economy/">Internet Economy</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./now-on-wordpress.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Now on WordPress</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-future-for-self-driving-cars.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The future for self-driving cars</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2017-11-09T17:54" class="feed__date">November 9, 2017</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./ai-powered-robots-and-the-future.html">AI-powered robots and the future</a></h3></header><p>This is a post over which I have been pondering for quite a while.
