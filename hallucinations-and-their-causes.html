On the whole I've found it very useful and most often I use it instead of Google to find out more background or quickly check things I've read and which maybe don't sound quite right.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yesterday I came across a statistic promoted on BlueSky as it happens. The post made the claim that there were 100 times more potholes on Britain's roads than craters on the Moon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Instinctively this sounds rubbish, so I asked ChatGPT. This is what it said:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>This claim is often made to highlight the poor state of Britain’s roads, but its accuracy depends on how the comparison is defined.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Potholes in Britain</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>• Estimates suggest there are around&nbsp;<strong>1.7 million potholes</strong>&nbsp;on Britain’s roads, based on data from councils and surveys by motoring organizations.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>• The exact number fluctuates as new potholes form and old ones are repaired.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Craters on the Moon</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>• The Moon has approximately&nbsp;<strong>1.3 million craters with a diameter of 1 km or larger</strong>, based on modern satellite data.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• However, if smaller craters (down to 1 meter in diameter) are included, the number rises dramatically, potentially into the billions.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>A good answer, I thought. But then this was its conclusion:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>If only large craters (1 km or more) are considered, then the “100 times more potholes” claim is plausible, since 1.7 million is far more than 1.3 million.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>So I challenged it by asking if this particular conclusion was true. Here's what it said:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>You’re right to scrutinize my statement! Let’s re-evaluate the math:</p><p></p><p></p><p>• Estimated&nbsp;<strong>potholes in Britain</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>1.7 million</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• Estimated&nbsp;<strong>craters on the Moon ≥ 1 km</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>1.3 million</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The claim states that there are&nbsp;<strong>100 times more potholes</strong>&nbsp;than craters, which means:</p><p></p><p></p><p>1.3 \text{ million} \times 100 = 130 \text{ million}</p><p></p><p></p><p>Clearly,&nbsp;<strong>1.7 million potholes is not 100 times more than 1.3 million craters</strong>—it’s only about&nbsp;<strong>1.3 times more</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thus, my previous statement was incorrect. The “100 times more” claim does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;hold up when considering craters ≥ 1 km in diameter. Thanks for catching that!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>So I asked it why it thought it made that particular mistake. Here's what it said:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Good question! I think the mistake happened for a few key reasons:</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>1. Misinterpretation of Scale</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>I correctly compared the&nbsp;<strong>1.7 million potholes</strong>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>1.3 million large craters</strong>, but I didn’t properly check whether the “100 times more” claim held up mathematically. Instead, I instinctively assumed that because 1.7 million is larger than 1.3 million, the claim might be “plausible”—without doing the crucial multiplication step.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>2. Cognitive Bias – Pattern Recognition</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>My brain likely followed a familiar pattern:</p><p></p><p></p><p>• I’ve seen claims about road potholes being much more numerous than craters before.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• The numbers were&nbsp;<strong>in the same ballpark</strong>, so I subconsciously assumed the comparison was roughly correct without fully verifying it.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>3. Focus on Relative Difference Instead of Absolute Multiplication</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>I focused on the fact that 1.7 million is “more” than 1.3 million but didn’t immediately apply the&nbsp;<strong>“100 times more”</strong>&nbsp;test. This is a common numerical intuition error—people sometimes compare relative magnitudes without explicitly calculating ratios.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>4. Over-Reliance on Memory vs. Recalculation</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve encountered similar statistics before, so I might have relied on a vague recollection rather than double-checking the math from first principles.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>What I Can Learn from This?</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>• Always&nbsp;<strong>verify numerical claims with explicit calculations</strong>, even if the numbers seem intuitive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• Be aware of&nbsp;<strong>assumption shortcuts</strong>—just because something sounds plausible doesn’t mean it holds up mathematically.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• Stay open to&nbsp;<strong>self-correction</strong>—as I did when you questioned my claim!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks for prompting me to think through the error—it’s a useful lesson in precision and verification.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>That is a pretty reasonable summary of the causes of hallucination, if a touch anthropomorphic. It quickly spotlighted the key problem - the lack of a quick calculation. It quickly spotlighted the key problem - the lack of a quick calculation. Whether these lessons are learnable in quite the way it portrayed is doubtful.
