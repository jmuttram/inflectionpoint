I'm not sure I would now agree with my prediction that&nbsp;indigenous&nbsp;innovation would suffer, but certainly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/world/asia/china-shuts-down-web-sites-after-coup-rumors.html">the climate for internet services doesn't seem very much better</a>.<br>--------------------------<br><br></p><blockquote>I was in Shanghai last week when the disagreement between Google and the Chinese Government&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9173880/Update_Google_stops_censoring_in_China">stepped up a gear</a>&nbsp;and Google pointed local traffic to unsensored results in Hong Kong. The immediate effect was very erratic services for many Google services as the Chinese Government worked out what to do. Google has started providing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/prc/report.html">its own update</a>&nbsp;of the state of its various services and you can see the continuing fall out.<br>Facebook and Twitter were also blocked last week - but that is now normal.<br>Some commentators are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/26/AR2010032603133.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">arguing that Google should reconsider</a>&nbsp;and get back into the market in mainland China as the market is too big and fast-growing to ignore. Whatever the merits of that argument, the current policy the Chinese Government is pursuing is more likely to hurt China than help it, I think.<br>True, there are now very vibrant Chinese companies serving the same functions as the global giants -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a>&nbsp;for search for instance, or&nbsp;<a href="http://qzone.qq.com/index.html">Qzone</a>&nbsp;for social networking - but without competition from global players innovation is likely to stagnate. And a China cut off from the network effects of the global internet economy will be a poorer place in the long run.</blockquote></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./will-apple-miss-the-next-big-thing.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Will Apple miss the next big thing?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-business-vs-technology.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> “The Business” vs technology</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-06-23T05:47" class="feed__date">June 23, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./internet-changes-everything-shock.html">Internet changes everything shock</a></h3></header><p>As the Internet grows up the news industry is being forever changed says the Washington Post in an article about the challenges and opportunity of the new media space.</p><a href="./internet-changes-everything-shock.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-05-09T22:20" class="feed__date">May 9, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./china-blogs-explode.html">China blogs explode</a></h3></header><p>Blogs in China are set to exceed 60 million by the end of the year, according to a study on China's media industry by Tsinghua University..</p><a href="./china-blogs-explode.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-04-26T18:36" class="feed__date">April 26, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./google-in-china.html">Google in China</a></h3></header><p>Clive Thompson has written an excellent piece in the New York Times on Google's move into China and the associated issues around censorship there.
