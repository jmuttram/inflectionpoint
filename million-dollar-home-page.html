As of <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5652179487&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:UK:31">this moment</a> the going price is $160,000! And there are three days left to go!<br><br>If you are not familiar with the story, the site was set up by 21-year-old Alex Tew of Swindon in Wiltshire "to fund his degree studies".<br><br>The idea was simple: he divided up his "home page" into 1,000,000 pixels (in 100 pixel blocks) and then sold these pixels for $1 each (minimum $100). He guarantees to keep the site running for five years and probably for much longer than that, and so he points out that this equates to very good value for money.<br><br>Actually, it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a really good contract for both parties: Alex gets his $1m which makes for a good start in life; the advertisers get a huge amount of exposure as the idea has grabbed so much attention. Most of the advertisers are small outfits (and some have posted testimonials which seem genuinely pleased with the response). There are even larger firms, like <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/">The Times</a> .<br><br>To get some idea how much value these advertisers are getting, take a look at this Alexa chart which compares his traffic to that of New Scientist, one of RBI's largest sites...<br><a href="http://www.inflectionpointblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/graph.png"><img loading="lazy" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="./media/posts/128/graph-300x170.png" alt="" border="0" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/128/responsive/graph-300x170-xs.png 640w, ./media/posts/128/responsive/graph-300x170-sm.png 768w, ./media/posts/128/responsive/graph-300x170-md.png 1024w, ./media/posts/128/responsive/graph-300x170-lg.png 1366w, ./media/posts/128/responsive/graph-300x170-xl.png 1600w, ./media/posts/128/responsive/graph-300x170-2xl.png 1920w"></a>It is actually as of this moment about the 400th largest site on the internet - extraordinary considering it is really just the one page.<br><br>It does by now have its imitators, such as the <a href="http://www.millionyenhomepage.jp/faq.php">Million Yen Home Page</a> - yes, really. As yet, this site has not sold a single pixel. And there is a fair chance that none of these imitators will actually be worth the investment.<br><br>The magic of this idea was that it was a first, and genuinely captured the imagination and attention of the internet world, thus ensuring huge visibility for no outlay for Alex. I doubt if successors will be so lucky.<br><br>Still, nice to know innovation isn't dead.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./trust-in-online-sources.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Trust in online sources</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./china-becomes-number-2-online.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> China becomes number 2 online</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-10-17T17:12" class="feed__date">October 17, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./securing-100-million-laptops.html">Securing 100 Million Laptops</a></h3></header><p>eWeek points out that Nicholas Negropote's plan to deploy 100 million laptops will create the "largest computing monoculture" in the world, and hence the world's biggest security headache.</p><a href="./securing-100-million-laptops.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-07-17T12:24" class="feed__date">July 17, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./youtube-serves-up-100-million-videos-a-day.html">YouTube Serves Up 100 Million Videos a Day</a></h3></header><p>According to eWeek YouTube, the video sharing site, has broken through the 100 million videos served up a day barrier.
