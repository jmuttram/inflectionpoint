The modern smart phone is vastly more powerful and capable than anyone could have predicted and the modern internet is a phenomenon way beyond prediction.</p><p>Some things which were predicted did come to pass - Dick Tracy's wrist radio (Apple - and Android - watch) and Star Trek's universal translator (Google translate) for example. But no flying car.</p><p>At least not until now. At CES this week Chinese company EHang <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/06/the-ehang-184-is-a-human-sized-drone-taking-off-at-ces">showcased the EHang 184</a>, a human-sized drone designed to take it's owner at 60 mph for 23 minutes completely automatically.  Obviously there are many, many hurdles to overcome before anyone will actually be able to fly such a device in open sky. But it it does seem to me that this might just be part of the future.</p><figure class="size-medium wp-image-1583"><a href="http://www.inflectionpointblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1583"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/1398/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199.png" alt="EHang 184" width="300" height="199" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1398/responsive/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199-xs.png 640w, ./media/posts/1398/responsive/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199-sm.png 768w, ./media/posts/1398/responsive/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199-md.png 1024w, ./media/posts/1398/responsive/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199-lg.png 1366w, ./media/posts/1398/responsive/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199-xl.png 1600w, ./media/posts/1398/responsive/screen-shot-2016-01-06-at-4-41-57-pm-300x199-2xl.png 1920w"></a></figure>EHang 184 human-sized drone<p></p><p>You only have to watch a movie like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/">The Fifth Element</a> to realise the hopeless impracticality of allowing humans to drive things in three dimensions. But maybe it's the coming of self-driving cars which will finally allow the flying car to become a reality. If computers can reliably and safely drive us around in two dimensions, why not let them branch out into three. The frameworks necessary to allow self-driving cars to become a reality on our roads would, on the face of it, seem relatively simple to extend to the corridors of sky, too.</p><p>So, although EHang seems ridiculously optimistic at the moment, maybe the company is on to something.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/futurism/">Futurism</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./reinventing-society.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Reinventing society</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./how-smart-is-the-smart-keyboard.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> How smart is the Smart Keyboard?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
