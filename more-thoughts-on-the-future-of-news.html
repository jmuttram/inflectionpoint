In the talk he gives an optimistic assessment of the prospects of news reporting in the future with two possible exceptions: war reporting and international coverage.<br><br>Johnson uses the past as a guide to future developments and points out how difficult it was to get information about Apple in 1989 compared to today when there are literally hundreds of sources of up to date information to choose from - ranging from conventional magazines to blogs of all sizes and specialisations. This is true of the whole technology information space.<br><br>And what started in the technology information space, and spread quickly to politics, he says will spread to all sectors in time. And in local reporting, where there is currently a lot of angst in both the US and the UK, the situation will also be better in the future, he argues, than in the past. He is co-founder of a hyper-local site called <a href="http://www.outside.in/">outside.in</a> which aims to aggregate neighbourhood-level information, an example of the kind of development he predicts will become commonplace.<br><br>The reason for the current depression, he argues, there should have been a decade-long transition from paper to online business models.<br><br></p><blockquote>Instead, the financial meltdown – and some related over-leveraging by the newspaper companies themselves – has taken what should have been a decade-long process and crammed it down into a year or two.</blockquote><p></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/media" rel="tag">media</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/newspapers" rel="tag">newspapers</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/financial%20crisis" rel="tag">financial crisis</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/SXSW" rel="tag">SXSW</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-future-of-london.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1242/responsive/tesla-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="431" width="431"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> The future of London</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./a-new-kind-of-attention.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> A new kind of attention</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-07-19T17:27" class="feed__date">July 19, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./hubdub-predicting-the-news.html">Hubdub - predicting the news</a></h3></header><p>Hubdub is a news prediction site which aims to use crowdsourcing to predict the outcome of events.
