Firstly he says the problem is framed wrongly. It's not "we can't keep our best people" it's "we're not winning". Start winning again and your problems will (mostly) go away. But, he say, aside from this, there are things you can do:<br>1.

Keep the key players - the magnets who the other good people want to be around<br>3. Clean house. Get rid of the mediocre people and the people who joined in the good times because they were the good times.<br>4. Promote your best people<br>5. Simplify and clarify the organisational structure<br>6. Take out layers - especially at the top.<br><br>So, there you are....<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/organisation" rel="tag">organisation</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tips" rel="tag">tips</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./picassa-advances.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Picassa advances</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./economic-models-explained-by-cows.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Economic models explained by cows</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-10-24T15:39" class="feed__date">October 24, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./tracking-people-in-blogs.html">Tracking people in blogs</a></h3></header><p>pmeme is a new site which aims to track mentions of people in the blogosphere.
