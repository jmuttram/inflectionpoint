I think most big companies spend a lot of time puzzling over how to increase agility and innovative spirt in their organisations, and most don't really make much of a fist of it.</p><p>One reason, I believe, is that as companies grow complexity increases. In a start-up mode everybody does everything (more or less) but later specialisms emerge and so getting things done involve large groups of "experts".They are already busy, so co-ordination becomes a real challenge and progress slows, a process Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, founders of 37 Signals, offer an antidote to in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745" target="_blank">their book Rework.</a></p><p>Another reason is IT complexity; multiple systems are "upgraded" and added to over long periods of time so that integrating with them becomes a mammoth task, and doing so only increases the complexity and inter-dependency.</p><p>So is there a way to cut through this? I don't really know, but I do believe that the recent developments of cloud computing which allow <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/" target="_blank">small pieces loosely joined</a> but running on other people's infrastructure do offer real hope here. If you are renting computing cycle time and storage from Amazon for a few dollars, it is much more easy to imagine lots more innovative small projects getting off the ground outside of the corporate spaghetti. It is (relatively) easy for start-ups like 37 Signals to keep the agility and simplicity in their businesses - it's much harder for corporates who have spent years building up complexity and the organistional structures which keep things complex.</p><p style="font-size: 10px;"><a href="http://posterous.com/">Posted via email</a> from <a href="http://muttram.com/innovation-and-big-companies">Inflection Point v2</a></p></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-great-paywall-experiment.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Great Paywall Experiment</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./bowtie-vs-diamond.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Bowtie vs. Diamond</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-04-29T05:18" class="feed__date">April 29, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-roots-of-innovation.html">The roots of innovation</a></h3></header><p>For some reason I've found myself reading E H Gombrich's A Little History of the World and I was struck by this particular passage on the ascendency of the Greeks: Now unlike the Egyptians, the Babylonians and the Assyrians, these noblemen weren't interested in preserving&hellip;</p><a href="./the-roots-of-innovation.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-02-23T20:19" class="feed__date">February 23, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-social-dimension-of-companies.html">The social dimension of companies</a></h3></header><p>A couple of stories which have been blowing up on the Twittersphere over the past couple of days serve to illustrate the point that organisations' reputations are very vulnerable to their employees' (or affiliates') actions online - and in particular on social media.
