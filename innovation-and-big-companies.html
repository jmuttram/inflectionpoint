I think most big companies spend a lot of time puzzling over how to increase agility and innovative spirt in their organisations, and most don't really make much of a fist of it.</p><p>One reason, I believe, is that as companies grow complexity increases. In a start-up mode everybody does everything (more or less) but later specialisms emerge and so getting things done involve large groups of "experts".They are already busy, so co-ordination becomes a real challenge and progress slows, a process Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, founders of 37 Signals, offer an antidote to in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745" target="_blank">their book Rework.</a></p><p>Another reason is IT complexity; multiple systems are "upgraded" and added to over long periods of time so that integrating with them becomes a mammoth task, and doing so only increases the complexity and inter-dependency.</p><p>So is there a way to cut through this? I don't really know, but I do believe that the recent developments of cloud computing which allow <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/" target="_blank">small pieces loosely joined</a> but running on other people's infrastructure do offer real hope here. If you are renting computing cycle time and storage from Amazon for a few dollars, it is much more easy to imagine lots more innovative small projects getting off the ground outside of the corporate spaghetti. It is (relatively) easy for start-ups like 37 Signals to keep the agility and simplicity in their businesses - it's much harder for corporates who have spent years building up complexity and the organistional structures which keep things complex.</p><p style="font-size: 10px;"><a href="http://posterous.com/">Posted via email</a> from <a href="http://muttram.com/innovation-and-big-companies">Inflection Point v2</a></p></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-great-paywall-experiment.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Great Paywall Experiment</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./bowtie-vs-diamond.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Bowtie vs. Diamond</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2012-02-23T19:16" class="feed__date">February 23, 2012</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./what-is-innovation.html">What is Innovation?</a></h3></header><p>What is innovation?&nbsp;The&nbsp;Oxford English Dictionarydefines it, somewhat unhelpfully, as: “the action or process of innovating”;&nbsp;but, then elaborates: “a new method, idea, product, etc.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It then goes on to note: “innovation is crucial to the continuing success of any organization.” As innovation is so important, I thought&hellip;</p><a href="./what-is-innovation.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2009-12-09T12:11" class="feed__date">December 9, 2009</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./is-bootstrapping-killing-innovation.html">Is bootstrapping killing innovation?</a></h3></header><p>A lot has been made of the game-changing way new start ups can now test their ideas with very little money using free, online tools and pay-as-you-go computing like Amazon's EC2 and S3.
