This was especially the case in media and advertising, which served only companies of a certain size because only large companies could afford to advertise in large outlets. But Google’s marketplace for advertisers of all sizes represents the small-is-the-new-big economy: no limit of small enterprises that can now add up to a critical mass. The fact that it is an auction marketplace also means that this economy is more fluid; it fills in voids.</blockquote><p>This means Google may be protected from an economic downturn in quite unprecedented ways:<br></p><blockquote>when there’s an economic downturn that affects, say, travel, that will affect a magazine like Condé Nast Traveler; airlines and hotels of a certain size will advertise less and there aren’t new advertisers to fill in that void at Traveler’s price. But on Google, if American Airlines and the Ritz aren’t buying the keyword “Paris” this month, there are no end of advertisers who will step in to buy the word. The price of that keyword may decline. But in Google’s very broad economy, the prices of other keywords (e.g., “credit”) may rise.</blockquote><p>Comscore started a run on Google's stock by <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Search/Googles-Paid-Click-Rate-Sparks-Fears-of-Weak-Q1/">pointing out that fewer people were clicking on Google's ads</a> - though Google said it was tuning ad placement to improve relevance. In the end Google ends up looking <a href="http://www.comscore.com/blog/2008/02/why_googles_surprising_paid_click_data_are_less_surprising.html">smarter than Comscore</a> and Jeff argues that the old sampling methodology's days are numbered as it simply can't measure the niches.<br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/advertising" rel="tag">advertising</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/economy" rel="tag">economy</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Google" rel="tag">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/metrics" rel="tag">metrics</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./alexa-announcement.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Alexa Announcement</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-new-york-times-covers-blogging.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The New York Times covers blogging</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-08-07T10:03" class="feed__date">August 7, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./googles-new-search-analysis-tool.html">Google&#x27;s new search analysis tool</a></h3></header><p>Google has released an updated version of Trends called Insights for Search.
