While undoubtedly impressive, I'm not sure the epithets really fit the bill...</p><p>Elon Musk, on the other hand, seems to have invented a new language to deal with the highly experimental and ground-breaking work he is involved in. Take the goal of SpaceX to develop re-usable rockets. There is clearly a lot to learn as this has never been done before. Therefore every failure is a step on the path to learning how to achieve reliable reusability. With the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10544247/Meet-tech-billionaire-and-real-life-Iron-Man-Elon-Musk.html">Ironman allusions</a> and fan worship it is nye-on impossible for social media, or indeed main stream media, to deal calmly with the failures as well as the successes. Hence this:</p><p>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/743097668725940225</p><p>"Explosion" or "crash" smacks of failure. "RUD" speaks to a more reasoned, experimental and scientific approach.</p><p>This more measured approach to a complex world, as well as the humour, is surely worth adopting far more widely.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/futurism/">Futurism</a></li><li><a href="./tags/product-management/">Product Management</a></li><li><a href="./tags/technology/">Technology</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./thinking-digitally-in-tyneside.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Thinking Digitally in Tyneside</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./spot-the-inconsistency.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Spot the inconsistency...</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2007-08-07T21:37" class="feed__date">August 7, 2007</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./beyond-in-new-role-with-cmp.html">Beyond in new role with CMP</a></h3></header><p>CMP has sold techcareers to Beyond.com the business recruitment site in the UK.
