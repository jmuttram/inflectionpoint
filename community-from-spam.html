I just deleted as I mostly do with this kind of spam as I have found in the past that the "unsubscribe" options is only partially effective and, anyway, &nbsp;I've got better things to do with my time.<br><br>Pretty soon though I started to get emails from people who were in a similar boat asking to be unsubscribed, while later others emailed (again the whole list) to ask fellow victims not to reply as they were beginning to escalate into spam session.<br><br>Then two interesting things happened. Firstly, someone suggested that instead of spamming each other perhaps we should create a LinkedIn group and find out more about each other to see what we all had in common. The group is called &nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Unified-Spam-Social-Experiment-4336202?home=&amp;gid=4336202&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm&amp;goback=.gmp_4336202">Unified by Spam - The Social Experiment</a>&nbsp;and on it you can see a growing band of people joining and talking to each other, and even a poll which identifies which industries/parts of the world the participants come from etc.<br><br>Secondly, a sub-set of the original recipients have ignored both the initial advice to desist from trying to message back to the original perpetrator <u>and</u> the invitation to join the social experiment. They are busy still spamming in an increasingly irate and profane way - the result of which is that I am getting a notification every few minutes that a message is being quarantined by the Exchange Profanity Filter. There is nothing I can now do about these messages.<br><br>I was struck by how neatly this episode summarises the two basic types of participants in web discussions everywhere.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./what-is-innovation.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> What is Innovation?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./will-apple-miss-the-next-big-thing.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Will Apple miss the next big thing?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2008-10-21T12:23" class="feed__date">October 21, 2008</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./tips-for-community-editors.html">Tips for Community Editors</a></h3></header><p>Some tips for and by community editors in the Online Journalism Blog series.
