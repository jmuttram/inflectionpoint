Wired News</a><br></p><blockquote>Lycos is selling its Wired News unit to Condé Nast Publications for $25 million, Lycos parent Daum Communications announced in Korea late Tuesday, a deal that brings Wired.com and Wired magazine under the same owner after an eight-year separation.<br><br>Lycos acquired Wired News as part of its June 1999 acquisition of Wired Digital in a stock transaction valued at about $83 million at the time. Since then, Wired News has published Wired magazine articles on the web under a contractual relationship, while reporting independently on technology and science news.<br><br>Tuesday's deal includes all the assets of Wired News, such as the website, news content and domain name, but leaves Lycos in control of former Wired Digital properties such as HotBot, Hotwired and Webmonkey. Upon completion of the transaction, the assets of Wired News will be operated as part of Condé Nast Publications' web division, CondéNet. No layoffs at Wired News are planned as a result of the deal.</blockquote></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./penton-media-on-the-block.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Penton Media on the block</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-long-tail-vs-pirates.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The long tail vs Pirates</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-11-03T09:43" class="feed__date">November 3, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./wired-buys-reddit.html">Wired buys Reddit</a></h3></header><p>Wired has bought social media site Reddit, according to PaidContent. “Our goal will be to build Reddit as an independent company by collaborating with Wired through the integration of its core technology, and by offering partnerships to allow other companies to do the same,” says&hellip;</p><a href="./wired-buys-reddit.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-10-07T18:59" class="feed__date">October 7, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./wired-on-ozzie.html">Wired on Ozzie</a></h3></header><p>The current issue of Wired has a feature on Ray Ozzie, the man who will take over the spiritual guidance of Microsoft from Bill Gates next summer.</p><a href="./wired-on-ozzie.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-08-29T11:51" class="feed__date">August 29, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./wired-the-wiki-way.html">Wired the wiki way</a></h3></header><p>Wired is writing a story about wikis - as a wiki.
