I would not be surprised if we see European countries advertising themselves on the quality of their regulatory safeguards. And neither would I be surprised if the current Government insouciance at criticism of GCHQ oversight begins to crack when hard economic consequences are felt.<br><br>The internet has grown so fast and technology so powerful so quickly that the legal and regulatory framework in the West is way behind. This move by an internet giant (and potentially others to come) may be what it takes to start a grown up debate about the kinds of trade-offs and safeguards a modern society needs. So far it looks like indiscriminate tapping of the Yahoo messenger chats of millions of innocent citizens has occurred at the potential expense of a future lack of co-operation in the case of a genuine investigation into real suspects. Talk about own-goal.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/internet-economy/">Internet Economy</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./a-new-employer-employee-compact.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> A new employer-employee compact</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./to-glass-or-not-to-glass.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> To Glass or not to Glass</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1367/responsive/robert-scoble-google-glass-shower-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="360" width="360"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2006-09-13T08:21" class="feed__date">September 13, 2006</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./rss-still-the-first-inning.html">RSS - Still the First Inning</a></h3></header><p>Interesting piece from Steve Rubel on his views on the future of RSS in marketing.
