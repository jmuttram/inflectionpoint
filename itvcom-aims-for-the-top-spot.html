His message: television is alive and kicking! ITV channels reach 81% of the population and the free to air model is sound, he says. Now they are making the journey to free to screen. The aim is to be the UK's favourite source of free entertainment. The reason: the online advertising opportunity is strong. By 2010 he wants to have £150m of online advertising and he is confident because, he says, of the new <a href="http://www.itv.com/">ITV.com</a> - which, I note, doesn't yet support the Mac! This includes user generated content (Jeff claims that ITV invented user generated content - through You've Been Framed) and web-only commissioned content.<br><br>He finishes his talk with<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=paul+potts&amp;search=Search"> a clip of Paul Potts </a>on Britain's got Talent. The challenge - three times as many people watched this on YouTube as watched it on ITV. That is the challenge that ITV.com is aiming to meet.<br><br><br><br></p><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/AOP%2007" rel="tag">AOP 07</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./unilevers-approach-to-digital-marketing.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Unilever&#x27;s approach to digital marketing</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2016-10-04T08:22" class="feed__date">October 4, 2016</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./spot-the-inconsistency-2.html">Spot the inconsistency</a></h3></header><p>Lord Dubs, the Labour peer this year persuaded the government to promise to give sanctuary to vulnerable unaccompanied child refugees with no relatives in the UK.
