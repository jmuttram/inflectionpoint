Readers are migrating online, and advertisers are following them. People are demanding customised news, wherever and whenever they want it. We have to adapt to these realities, or face a future of decline which goes to the very heart of our business,' he said.<br><br>'As big as the challenges are, there are unparalleled opportunities, too. In a multimedia world, strong brands will flourish. And the Telegraph - with its hallmarks of honesty, integrity and reliability - is perfectly placed to become the digital market leader in news and comment.<br><br>'There should be no limit to our ambitions, provided we embrace this sea change in the information society with imagination and determination. There should be no limit, either, to what our brilliant journalists and writers can achieve..."</blockquote></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./times-blogs.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Times blogs</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./internet-stats-in-one-place.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Internet stats in one place</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-12-24T09:55" class="feed__date">December 24, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./online-advertisings-tipping-point-approaching.html">Online Advertising&#x27;s Tipping Point Approaching?</a></h3></header><p>According to a piece in ClickZ News: the 'tipping point' for offline ad dollars moving online may be here in the second half of 2006, according to a report by Piper Jaffray analyst Safa Rashtchy.</p><a href="./online-advertisings-tipping-point-approaching.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-12-30T12:36" class="feed__date">December 30, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./online-ads-to-rise-in-2006.html">Online ads to rise in 2006</a></h3></header><p>According to a report by Bloomberg.com online advertising is set to rise by 32% next year.</p><a href="./online-ads-to-rise-in-2006.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2005-09-23T13:49" class="feed__date">September 23, 2005</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./quality-online.html">Quality online</a></h3></header><p>Chris Horrie has done lots of stuff around journalism, writing and lecturing, and he's also a writer of books including "Stick it up your punter!".
