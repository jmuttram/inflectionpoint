And I didn't just switch broadband - I changed my landline and my TV package at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The catalyst for this move?</p><p></p><p>I've actually been quite happy with BT for quite a few years but a few months ago I noticed that the speed I was getting on my supposedly 8mb broadband line was very low - around 1.5mb quite often. I reported it (through BT's very efficient Indian call centre). After a few days of tinkering around the speed did seem to improve. But then the line started dropping - sometimes four or five times a day, and the line was down for quite long periods of time.</p><p></p><p>I reported this and they looked into this problem too. Again, the Indian support centre looked into it. This time, though, they said they found the problem. The <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bt.cfg/php/enduser/cci/bt_adp.php?p_faqid=10495&amp;cat_lvl1=346&amp;p_cv=1.346&amp;p_cats=346&amp;s_cid=con_FURL_broadbandusagepolicy">FUP (Fair Use Policy)</a> had been invoked - apparently we had been using too much bandwidth so our connection had been artificially slowed down and that was causing the instability. I was told that if I contacted the FUP team they would lift the restriction as it was causing technical problems.</p><p></p><p>So I called. There was a very polite woman on the phone who explained that our usage was quite a bit above average and asked if there was anything particular we were doing with the connection. I explained there were five of us in the house using the connection, two of us playing online games, but nothing special. Then she asked if we had an Xbox. Yes, I said. That explained it, she said. Xbox Live uses a lot of bandwidth sending information back and forth.</p><p></p><p>So it seems, that if you have an Xbox you need another provider - BT wants the kind of users who use the internet for email and browsing - maybe so that the usage patterns don't interfere with their plans for interactive BT Vision - interactive TV.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, I'm happy with my move and with my <a href="http://allyours.virginmedia.com/websales/product.do?id=15208&amp;buspart=Portal_HP_2_3">50mb broadband</a> - as are the hard-core gamers in my family.</p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-mouse-that-roared.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The mouse that roared?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./battlestar-galactica-and-the-art-of-the-future.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Battlestar Galactica and the art of the future</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
