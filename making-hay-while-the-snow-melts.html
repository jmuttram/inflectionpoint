The culprit is identified as global warming:<br></p><blockquote><span style="font-family: inherit;">Flooding<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18.987144470214844px;">&nbsp;has been identified as the most dangerous impact of&nbsp;</span>climate change<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18.987144470214844px;">&nbsp;for the UK and is hitting harder and faster than expected, according to scientists. Thousands of homes have been flooded since December, and much of the low-lying Somerset Levels remains under water.</span></span></blockquote><p>It went on to detail the price to be paid both in flood defence expenditures and annual flood damage which will result from increasingly erratic weather patterns.<br><br>Then there was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/science/earth/threat-to-bottom-line-spurs-action-on-climate.html?_r=0">a piece</a> in the Observer's New York Times supplement entitled&nbsp;<i>Industry Awakens to Threat of Climate Change </i>which detailed the concerns that large US corporates like Coca-Cola and Nike are now expressing about the adverse effects of climate change on their businesses.<i>&nbsp;</i><br></p><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="./media/posts/1371/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="./media/posts/1371/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz.jpg" height="200" width="197" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1371/responsive/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/BfPXs4LIIAAYsCz-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></div><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 23px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Increased droughts, more unpredictable variability, 100-year floods every two years,” said Jeffrey Seabright, Coke’s vice president for environment and water resources, listing the problems that he said were also disrupting the company’s supply of sugar cane and sugar beets, as well as citrus for its fruit juices. “When we look at our most essential ingredients, we see those events as threats.”</span></span></blockquote><p>Finally, back in the main paper,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/arctic-city-new-route-china?guni=Keyword:news-grid%20main-1%20Main%20trailblock:Editable%20trailblock%20-%20news:Position6">this piece</a> on the exciting opportunities which the melting of the polar icecap are opening up for the energy and shipping industries. The effects of climate change are being felt faster in the northern pole than elsewhere on the planet with the prospects that a northern sea route will open up and swathes of the arctic can be explored for oil, gas and minerals.<br></p><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18.987144470214844px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Confidence that the Arctic will become economically important is seen in the rush of countries and companies to claim a stake. Eleven countries, including Poland and Singapore, have appointed Arctic ambassadors to promote their national interests.</span></span></blockquote><p>It is splendidly ironic that the burning of fossil fuels causes the planet to warm up so that the north pole melts and we can find more fossil fuels to burn, thus continuing the cycle. There is a wonderful comment in the comments thread of the article online which sums it up perfectly....<br></p><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="./media/posts/1371/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="./media/posts/1371/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13.png" height="99" width="320" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1371/responsive/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13-xs.png 640w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13-sm.png 768w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13-md.png 1024w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13-lg.png 1366w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13-xl.png 1600w, ./media/posts/1371/responsive/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-15.02.13-2xl.png 1920w"></a></div><p>&nbsp;And the New Yorker cartoon (above) earlier this week illustrated the short-termism appositely.<br><br>One thing is clear, until we price carbon correctly and align short term economic interests to the long term interests of the planet (and the human species) we will see more and more of this schizophrenic behaviour.<br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/climate-change-2/">Climate Change</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./how-to-tell-if-design-thinking-has-taken-hold-in-your-organisation.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1372/responsive/Screen-Shot-2013-12-02-at-17.37.27-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="509" width="509"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> How to tell if design thinking has taken hold in your organisation</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./sharing-health-data-safely.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Sharing health data - safely</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="./media/posts/1370/responsive/doctor-surgery-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="375" width="375"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2019-06-10T11:11" class="feed__date">June 10, 2019</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./the-decision-making-process.html">The Decision-making process</a></h3></header><p>Why did I decide to buy a Tesla Model X?
