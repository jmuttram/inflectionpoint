But Jeremy Leggett believes there are strong reasons why this fracking revolution isn't going to happen. First, the U.S. success story is unravelling fast and may implode before the UK general election next May. That would force an abrupt change of line, he believes. Second, the British (and perhaps particularly those in the Tory shires) are pathologically opposed which makes it difficult to envisage, especially in the new era of minority government and coalitions.</p><p>The final reason Jeremy Leggett seems a lot more positive than many in the environmental movement is the growing acceptance by the financial community of the sizeable risk of a carbon bubble. Even the Bank of England is now examining the question to assess the systemic risk.</p><p>Taken together, he believes these narratives are turning the tide.</p><p>He is serialising, for free, a book outlining his arguments which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.jeremyleggett.net/comments-on-the-winning-of-the-carbon-war/">here</a>.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/climate-change-2/">Climate Change</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-elephant-in-the-room.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Elephant in the Room</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./ignoring-the-elephant.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Ignoring the Elephant</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2018-10-08T11:40" class="feed__date">October 8, 2018</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./climate-disaster-and-how-to-avoid-it.html">Climate disaster and how to avoid it</a></h3></header><p>Today the IPCC came out with its sternest warning yet about the dangers the world faces if global warming isn't held to 1.5degC.
