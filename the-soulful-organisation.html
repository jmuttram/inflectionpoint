The idea, as I understand it, is that instead of central strategy, planning and budgetary frameworks the organisation is left to respond to challenges and adapt as it goes along (almost like a susurration of starlings).</p><p>The presumption is that the people within the organisation understand where they are collectively going and what they are trying to achieve and are best placed to ensure the organisation gets there. I can't help feeling this assumption may not always be true.</p><p>I'm looking forward to reading the book to see what more Mr Laloux has to say on the subject.</p><p><a href="./media/posts/1383/IMG_4382.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/1383/IMG_4382.jpg" alt="IMG_4382.JPG" width="3000" height="2250" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1383/responsive/IMG_4382-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1383/responsive/IMG_4382-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1383/responsive/IMG_4382-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1383/responsive/IMG_4382-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1383/responsive/IMG_4382-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1383/responsive/IMG_4382-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a>RSA Chief Executive Matthew Taylor (left) with Frederic Laloux</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="./tags/business/">Business</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./more-resilient-cities.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> More Resilient Cities</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-elephant-in-the-room.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Elephant in the Room</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
