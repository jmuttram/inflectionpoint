If we thought of universities as normal businesses we would say, 'Will they be able to adapt to the PC revolution?' It's that kind of question. Will Harvard or MIT, Oxford or Cambridge, be able to adapt? Or will Microsoft come out of nowhere?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">"It's going to be really fascinating to see it unfold."</span></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;I must say I have been having very similar thoughts. A few weeks ago I signed up for an MOOC being hosted by </span><a href="http://www.coursera.org/" style="font-family: inherit;">Coursera</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> and organised by</span><a href="http://danariely.com/" style="font-family: inherit;"> Dan Ariely</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> of Duke University. The course, on behavioural economics, is a real eye opener. It is six weeks long (I'm just entering the sixth and final week) and involves video lectures, in-video quizzes, recommended and&nbsp;</span>compulsory<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;reading assignments, reading quizzes and a writing assignment. There are also guest lecturer appearances on video (with some lecturers from some pretty impressive institutions) and a comprehensive set of forums where the thousands of participants can ask questions and offer mutual support.&nbsp;</span><br><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/missy-and-the-universe/" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="./media/posts/1349/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300.jpg" width="240" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/1349/responsive/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/1349/responsive/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/1349/responsive/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/1349/responsive/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/1349/responsive/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/1349/responsive/118241139_61ac58d627-225x300-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;">Flickr picture courtesy missy and the universe</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Other innovations which I thought really interesting were the weekly session with Dan Ariely (one hour long video q&amp;a) where he answered questions submitted by the students, and the chance to participate in behavioural experiments - either through&nbsp;</span>questionnaires<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; or in one case an interactive online person to person version of the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game"> Ultimatum Game</a>&nbsp;where I was matched at random with another fellow student.</span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">So far, I have found it extremely rich and rewarding. It isn't the same as a university experience, obviously, and the one clear disadvantage of MOOCs is their lack of ability to award credible qualifications which would (currently?) be acceptable to employers. However, this may change and in the future employers may actually be more impressed by self-motivated self-learners who accumulate credits from this kind of offering, perhaps even valuing them more than qualifications from at least some more conventional universities - who knows.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, I agree with Jimmy Wales that, based on my limited experience, the universities are going to have to adopt at least some of these techniques if they are not to be challenged by new players with much more powerful and relevant learning experiences.&nbsp;</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" rel="author">Jim Muttram</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./the-second-half-of-the-chessboard.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The second half of the chessboard</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./the-post-scarcity-world.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The post-scarcity world</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/jim-muttram/" class="feed__author">Jim Muttram</a> <time datetime="2007-01-19T06:57" class="feed__date">January 19, 2007</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./zdnet-test-pay-per-performance.html">ZDNet test pay per performance</a></h3></header><p>Steve Rubel reports on developments at ZDNet: During a recent interview with Podtech's Maryam Scoble, Mary Jo Foley revealed that ZDNet has a payment scheme in place that rewards its bloggers based on the number of clicks their posts get.
